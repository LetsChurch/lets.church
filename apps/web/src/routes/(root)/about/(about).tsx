          Please do not let any giving to Let's Church interfere with giving to
          your local church. It is important that you first support your local
          community of believers before prayerfully considering how much you can
          give to Let's Church.

        <H2>Roadmap (The Future of Let's Church)</H2>
        <P>
          We have many new technology upgrades and features in the works for
          Let's Church.
        </P>
        <H3>Technology</H3>
        <Ul>
          <li>
            Additional servers for creating transcriptions and transcoding
            videos to speed up processing and onboarding. What currently takes
            several days will soon take minutes to hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additional transcript data to enable new features, including
            word-level timestamps (each word will have its own timestamp) for
            better segmentation and better search results.
          </li>
          <li>
            Live streaming capabilities (this will require additional
            specialized hardware and has its own challenges compared to standard
            video streaming).
          </li>
          <li>A mobile app.</li>
        </Ul>
        <H3>Features and User Experience</H3>
        <Ul>
          <li>
            Improved search and organization. Media will have tags so you can
            more easily differentiate between, e.g., sermons and podcasts. We
            will also implement channel search so you can more easily find who
            is on the platform.
          </li>
          <li>We will implement the ability to search your watch history.</li>
          <li>
            Church search. We are working on building out a map-enabled church
            search feature which will enable you to find and connect with local
            churches all around the country and, Lord willing, around the world.
          </li>
          <li>
            Creating podcasts for listing in podcast apps directly from media
            uploaded to Let's Church.
          </li>
          <li>
            Church website builder. We want to provide churches an easy way to
            create their own websites and easily embed the content they've
            already uploaded to Let's Church.
          </li>
          <li>Blogging and community features.</li>
          <li>Bookmarks and notes.</li>
          <li>Sermon notes.</li>
          <li>
            More sections, e.g., most-watched videos, most-liked videos, and
            trending topics.
          </li>
          <li>
            More content, including music, documentaries, and sermons from
            church history.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ways for you to directly support the churches and ministries on the
