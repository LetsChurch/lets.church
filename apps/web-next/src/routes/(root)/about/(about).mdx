# All About Let's Church

Let's Church is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to providing free
technology resources to Churches and Christian Ministries. Our flagship
offering is the site you are looking at right now: sermon and media hosting
with fully-searchable transcripts, 100% free of charge with no ads.

## The Public Domain

Not only is Letâ€™s Church free to use, but [our
code](https://gitlab.com/letschurch) is also open source and dedicated to the
public domain. Our philosophy behind how we operate is known as [The Dorean
Principle](/about/dorean).

## No Ads

Let's Church, as a company, will never run ads on principle. We rely entirely
on [support](#support-lets-church) from our users.

## Roadmap (The Future of Let's Church)

We have many new technology upgrades and features in the works for Let's Church.

### Technology

- Additional servers for creating transcriptions and transcoding videos to
  speed up processing and onboarding. What currently takes several days will
  soon take minutes to hours.
- Additional transcript data to enable new features, including word-level
  timestamps (each word will have its own timestamp) for better segmentation
  and better search results.
- Live streaming capabilities (this will require additional specialized
  hardware and has its own challenges compared to standard video streaming).
- A mobile app.

### Features and User Experience

- Improved search and organization. Media will have tags so you can more easily
  differentiate between, e.g., sermons and podcasts. We will also implement
  channel search so you can more easily find who is on the platform.
- We will implement the ability to search your watch history.
- Church search. We are working on building out a map-enabled church search
  feature which will enable you to find and connect with local churches all
  around the country and, Lord willing, around the world. Creating podcasts for
  listing in podcast apps directly from media uploaded to Let's Church. Church
  website builder. We want to provide churches an easy way to create their own
  websites and easily embed the content they've already uploaded to Let's
  Church.
- Blogging and community features.
- Bookmarks and notes.
- Sermon notes.
- More sections, e.g., most-watched videos, most-liked videos, and trending
  topics.
- More content, including music, documentaries, and sermons from Church
  history.
- Ways for you to directly support the churches and ministries on the platform.
