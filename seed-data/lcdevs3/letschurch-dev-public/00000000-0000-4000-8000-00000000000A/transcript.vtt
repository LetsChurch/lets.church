00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
 The Dorian Principle, a biblical response to the commercialization of Christianity by Conley Owens.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.960
 Chapter 9 The pattern of Co-labor, theory vs. practice

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.440
 As I sit here writing, I just returned from a restaurant that serves plant-based burgers

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.560
 they claim have comparable taste to their real beef.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.720
 I ordered one of each and conducted a blind taste test with my wife and daughter.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.080
 Plant-based meat substitutes seem like a great idea in theory.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.000
 Plants are more readily available than animals, so it should be cheaper.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.280
 Vegetables offer a better balance of nutrients than meat, so it should be healthier.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.080
 Recent products, using heme, a molecule found in blood, even promised to capture the exact

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.520
 same taste.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.040
 Yet all that theory immediately broke down in practice.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.480
 My wife and daughter immediately identified the imposter with no hesitation.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.120
 Indeed, I was not convinced by the taste either.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.360
 More than that, the plant burger was more expensive, and most research these days shows

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.240
 that plant-based meat substitutes are significantly worse for you than traditional would get

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.000
 it from the farm, fired up on the grill meat.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.560
 So far in this book, we've largely discussed theory.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.160
 We've looked at some of Jesus' impal's statements, but we have yet to see the Dorian principle

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.720
 at play over the larger scope of scripture.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.160
 Does our theory hold together in practice like rich, grass-fed beef, or does it immediately

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.360
 fall apart like a bean burger?

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.480
 Scripture is brimming with relevant texts, but in this chapter, I would like us to walk

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.000
 through some of the more prominent examples we see of Colabor.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.040
 Having one example from the Old Testament and several from the New, I'm hoping you will

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.620
 agree with me that not only do we have didactic statements illustrating this truth from Christ

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.840
 in his most prolific apostle, but we also have a rich cache of evidence to reinforce their

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.240
 statements.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.000
 Elijah and Elijah

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.160
 Among Old Testament narratives, the ministries of Elijah and Elijah stand out as particular

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.360
 examples of Colabor.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.720
 Certainly, there are others, such as the sacrifices and ties we examined in chapter 3.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.280
 However, unlike the ministries of most Old Testament prophets and priests, the ministries

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.560
 of Elijah and Elijah were not limited to the nation of Israel.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.000
 And this Gentile setting, we can see their reception of Colabor paired with an explicit

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.800
 rejection of reciprocity.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.440
 Like a diamond set on black velvet, the help they receive shines lustrous when held against

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.880
 the backdrop of refused finances.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.120
 The ministries of Elijah and Elijah are marked by the support of women who understood the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.200
 importance of using hospitality as a way to promote the ministry of the word of God.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.600
 In the case of Elijah, God instructs the widow of Zaratheth to provide for Elijah while

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.480
 he instructs Elijah to receive the widow's hospitality, 1st King 17839.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.920
 She gives out of her property, even offering her last bit of food, 1st King 1711-12.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.760
 Similarly, Elijah receives the sacrificial hospitality of the Shunamite, 2nd King's

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:41.320
 4-8-10, recognizing the difficulty involved, 2nd King's 4-13.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.440
 It might seem like a fair exchange since both of these women received back their dead,

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:52.640
 1st King's 177-24, 2nd King's 4-1837.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.680
 However, in both cases, the giving precedes the miracle, demonstrating that neither participated

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.920
 in an exchange or out of the sense of direct obligation.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.640
 Instead, their primary obligation is toward the Lord who commanded them.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:17.200
 Elijah, continuing on in Elijah's spirit, 2nd King's 2-9, miraculously heals Namon's

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.080
 leprosy, leading to his apparent conversion.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.920
 Yet despite the Syrian commander's urgings, he rejects his gift with a solemn oath.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.200
 Then he, Namon, returned to the man of God, Elijah.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.600
 He and all his company, and he came and stood before him, and he said, "Behold, I know

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.920
 that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel, so accept now a present from your

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.680
 servant."

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.840
 But he said, "As the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none, and he urged

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.120
 him to take it, but he refused."

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.520
 2nd King's 5-15-16.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.960
 In fact, Elijah rejects Namon's offering so adamantly that when his servant Gahazi goes

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:14.400
 afterward to secure the gift, he transfers Namon's leprosy to him as a generational curse.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.560
 2nd King's 5-20-27.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.760
 While this malediction no doubt arises from Gahazi's deceitfulness, Elijah explicitly condemns

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.000
 the nature of such an exchange.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.840
 Was it a time to accept money and garments?

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.080
 Olive orchards and vineyards?

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.960
 Sheep and oxen?

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.520
 Male servants and female servants?

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.840
 6th King's 5-26-B.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.400
 What distinguishes the two women in Namon?

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.320
 The women operate as co-laborers.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.760
 One is in Israelite, while the other has been specifically commissioned and instructed

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.400
 by God.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:59.080
 On the other hand, Namon is a pagan Gentile, 2nd King's 5-1.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:06.160
 One who has received the blessing of ministry and seeks an opportunity for unmediated repayment.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:13.480
 The two women offer hospitality as co-labor, but Namon's present is an attempt at reciprocity.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.000
 Jesus is entourage.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.920
 Jumping ahead to the New Testament, the disciples accepted support from other Jews living in the

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.720
 towns they visited.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.720
 Luke 10, 5-8.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.800
 However, many also followed Jesus in his disciples supporting them materially.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.240
 Soon afterward, he went on through cities and villages proclaiming and bringing the good

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.360
 news of the kingdom of God, and the twelve were with him, and also some women who had been

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.160
 healed of evil spirits and infirmities.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:49.760
 Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, and Joanna, the wife of Chusa,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:55.120
 Herod's household manager, and Susanna, and many others who provided for them out of their

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.440
 means.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.640
 Luke 8, 1-3.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.800
 These women co-labor with the disciples.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.880
 While they may occasionally assist more directly in ministry, they help most significantly through

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.480
 their financial contributions.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.960
 As Luke records, they have been healed by Christ and act out of thankfulness.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.840
 But we should not label this expression of gratitude as repayment or ministerial reciprocity.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.640
 Instead, they aim to co-labor supporting the ongoing work of ministry.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.160
 Lydia

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:35.200
 Chapter 4, I pointed out that the Philippian church partnered with Paul as a congregation.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:42.600
 I'd now like you to consider Lydia, a particular Philippian who partnered with him as an individual.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.240
 After the apostles' introduction, Lydia embraces Christianity.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.840
 She offers her hospitality to Paul, and surprisingly, he accepts.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.600
 And on the Sabbath day, we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we suppose there

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:03.120
 was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.920
 One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thia-Taira, a seller of purple

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.760
 goods, who was a worshiper of God.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.760
 The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.560
 And after she was baptized and her household as well, she urged us, saying, "If you have

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:28.560
 judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay," and she prevailed upon us,

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.120
 Acts 16, 14 through 15.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:37.200
 If Paul refuses support from new converts, why does he receive from Lydia?

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.520
 Prior to her conversion, Scripture describes her as a worshiper of God, indicating that

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.440
 she already affirmed the true faith through Judaism.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:54.640
 The Dorian principle explains both Paul's hesitation as well as his eventual acceptance.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.800
 He does not immediately receive Lydia's hospitality because she made desire to repay him.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:05.640
 However, as a worshiper of God who frequents a place of prayer on the Sabbath, she already

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.920
 has some place within the fellowship of God.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.400
 Paul does not condition Lydia's assistance on the timing of his visit, but on her willingness

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.520
 to serve the Lord.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.120
 Lydia understands the apostles' concerns and appeals to him according to our status

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.400
 as a "co-laborer."

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:29.560
 If you have judged me to be faithful, the hosts of Corinth.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:34.520
 So far, we've determined that Paul limits his rejection of Corinthian funds to the context

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.560
 of reciprocity.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.720
 Outside of this context, he willingly accepts support.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:46.160
 For example, we've noted that Paul states his eagerness to receive pro-Pempo support,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:52.880
 but as he discovers ready-currentian co-laborers, he receives from them as well.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:58.440
 While planting the church in Corinth, Paul receives help from others like Lydia, those

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.720
 who already belonged to the fellowship of God.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:08.560
 First, he stays with Aquila and Priscilla, fellow Jews, Acts 18-2.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:15.480
 Soon after, he stays with Titius Justice, a worshiper of God, who lived next to the synagogue,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.880
 Acts 18-7.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:23.200
 Since Paul established the church in Corinth, these people undoubtedly converted to Christianity

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.680
 through his ministry.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.880
 However, they were not converts from pagan religion.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.440
 The apostle freely receives their help as "co-labor" since he first encountered them

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.160
 as fellow servants of God.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.760
 After planting the church, Paul speaks of the hospitality he receives from Gaius, who

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:48.040
 is almost certainly the Gaius of Corinth, Romans 1623.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:55.560
 Phoebe's status as a patron, Romans 16-2, indicates that she has supported Paul in Corinth,

00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:01.480
 given that Sincere is a port of Corinth, and at least to be identified with the larger

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.680
 region of Echea.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.440
 Moreover, Paul spends a winter in Corinth.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.600
 Acts 23-6.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:16.280
 See, a first-current theon 16-6, receiving aid from the current theons.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:22.880
 These instances of hospitality count as "co-labor" even if none of them are explicitly financial.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.800
 As long as there is some material provisions such as lodging, it fits within the rubric

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.480
 of support, which Paul only selectively accepts.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:38.080
 Recall that in Thessalonica, Paul did not take anyone's bread without paying for it.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.640
 Second Thessalonians 3-8.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:48.640
 Recall also that Giaz's command revolved around receiving "Rumon Board" (Matthew 10-10).

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.280
 Philemon.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:56.080
 And Paul's shortest epistle, he appeals to Philemon to receive Onesimus, a runaway slave

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.360
 as a Christian brother.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.320
 So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.680
 If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.480
 I, Paul, write this with my own hand.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:19.320
 I will repay it to say nothing of your owing me, even your own self, Philemon 17-19.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.360
 The language of "co-labor" colors this account.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:27.920
 Paul calls Philemon a partner, having begun the letter addressing him as a fellow worker,

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.120
 Philemon 1.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:35.400
 Describing the affair as a business partnership, he negotiates with Philemon to charge anything

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.360
 owed to him to Paul's own account.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.160
 Philemon 18.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.400
 Paul's appealed personal debt, Philemon 19.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:49.120
 May seem to suggest Paul's anticipated reception of Onesimus as a transaction indicative of ministerial

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.480
 reciprocity.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:57.880
 However, this obligation to Paul is not immediate, but mediated through mutual obligation to Christ.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.600
 Filemon must comply, Philemon 8.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:07.160
 And it is this relationship that demands he honor Paul with his life.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:12.520
 Paul certainly did not die for Philemon, but because Christ died for him, he must respect

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:18.840
 the minister through whom he heard the gospel, CF Hebrews 13-7.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.920
 Once again, the vertical obligation regulates the horizontal obligation.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.880
 Additionally, Paul emphasizes the voluntary nature of Philemon's participation.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.840
 Philemon 8-9-14.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.440
 Indicating that there is no direct obligation that may be enforced.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:44.640
 Providing Philemon with another opportunity to co-labor, Paul requests a guest room.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.960
 At the same time, prepare a guest room for me.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:53.200
 For I am hoping that through your prayers, I will be graciously given to you, Philemon

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.200
 22.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:14:01.320
 In saying, at the same time, this request is not set in the context of a returned favor.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:06.880
 Instead, Paul contrasts his presence with Philemon to his present imprisonment.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:12.440
 He anticipates that he will be graciously given to Philemon, not particularly that Philemon

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.600
 will graciously give to him.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.000
 The Generosity of Malta.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:26.760
 In Acts, a chief official of Malta named Publius, hosts Paul for three days, Acts 28-7.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.960
 He may simply be a congenial pro-curator.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:35.080
 His Roman name hinting that it may be his job to watch the prisoners.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:40.200
 Given the variables at play, we cannot regard this hospitality as either an active horizontal

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:45.200
 reciprocity or an active co-labor.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.920
 This interaction with the Apostle at this point seems largely confined to Paul as a prisoner,

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.320
 rather than Paul as a minister.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:59.120
 However, these interactions change after Paul heals Publius' father and many other island

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.520
 residents.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:06.680
 At this point, the Maltese grant the Apostolic crew great honor and give them whatever they

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.280
 need for their travels, Acts 28-10.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.960
 Most likely, honor indicates this material gift.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.960
 C.F.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.800
 II Timothy 35-17.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:26.080
 Paul does not refuse gifts from these Gentiles, though he rejects gifts from many others.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.440
 Why would he accept this support?

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:35.160
 While the passage contains no explicit mention of the Gospel, the author obviously telescopes

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.920
 the narrative.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:44.000
 For example, we have no record that Paul rejected the title of God, Acts 28-6, yet he certainly

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.120
 did not accept it.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:51.960
 Everywhere else in the Gospels and Acts, Gospel proclamations accompany miraculous healings,

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.520
 and here we have no reason to anticipate anything different.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:01.640
 Therefore, we should almost certainly regard the bulk of the Maltese as converts, and especially

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.520
 given the timing of their aid, we may regard their gift as co-labor designed to alleviate

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:11.080
 Paul's persecution and assist in his missionary travels.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.720
 Gaius.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:18.440
 The Apostle John offers an example of co-labor when he instructs Gaius to support those

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.720
 missionaries who are worthy of support.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.600
 Beloved, it is a faithful thing you do in all your efforts for these brothers, strangers

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.400
 as they are, who testify to your love before the church.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.960
 You will do well to send them on their journey in a manner worthy of God, for they have gone

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:41.480
 out for the sake of the name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:47.120
 Therefore, we ought to supply people like these that we may be fellow workers for the truth.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.280
 Third John, 5-8.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.200
 The word for "send them on their journey" is pro-Pimpo, that same term we have seen Paul

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.000
 use in the context of financial support.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.120
 Here in this epistle, John identifies the act of giving to such men as co-labor, establishing

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.560
 a relationship between fellow workers.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.720
 This instruction complements the command in his previous epistle, not the partner in the

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.080
 wicked works of false teachers by accepting them into one's home.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:21.120
 That is, providing support in the form of room and board.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.400
 Second John, 10-11.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:29.600
 However, more significant to our investigation, John explains what makes these missionaries

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.560
 honorable.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:37.440
 They have gone out for the sake of the name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:42.560
 Going out for the sake of the name and accepting nothing from the Gentiles are not two independent

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.040
 accolades.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.640
 No conjunction distinguishes the two.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.760
 They must be recognized as linked.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.320
 Their placement and immediate proximity suggests that they are to be viewed as roughly equivalent

00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:00.880
 statements, accepting nothing being the sum proof that these men have gone out for the

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.640
 sake of the name.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:08.160
 That is, the fact that they do not take money demonstrates their sincerity, a lack of

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.680
 ulterior motives.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:16.160
 The term Gentiles does not primarily denote ethnicity, but is status outside the Kingdom

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.680
 of God.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:23.400
 John commends the financial support of missionaries from the church and an act of co-labor, but implicitly

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:28.800
 condemns as duplicitous the reciprocity that would necessarily characterize a financial

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.200
 gift from unbelievers.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.360
 Conclusion While scripture explicitly teaches the Dorian

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.880
 principle, it also demonstrates it implicitly as well.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:46.680
 In the Old Testament, Elijah and Elijah received co-labor, yet refused reciprocity.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:51.680
 In the New Testament, we see Jesus and Paul practice what they preach.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.600
 We even see this ethic at play in John's instructions to Gaius, where he praises churches

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:01.160
 partnering with missionaries and denounces receiving money from the subjects of the mission

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.560
 field.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.360
 End of chapter 9
