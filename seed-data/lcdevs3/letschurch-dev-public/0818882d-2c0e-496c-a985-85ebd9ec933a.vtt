00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
 The Dorian Principle

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:09.840
 A biblical response to the commercialization of Christianity by Conley Owens

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.320
 Conclusion

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.760
 A final word about the Gospel

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.080
 The prophet Isaiah describes salvation as water that is offered without money and without

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.320
 price

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.640
 Isaiah 551

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.800
 In the Gospels, Jesus explains he is the source of that living water, John 737

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.000
 On the final pages of Scripture, John records the repeated assertion that the Lord offers

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.080
 this water freely, Revelation 216, 2217

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.560
 As we consider the relationship between money and ministry, there is nothing less at stake

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.360
 than the proper advancement of the Gospel of Jesus Christ

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.720
 If the Dorian Principle correctly summarizes the ministry fundraising ethic of the New Testament,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.600
 the implications are far reaching

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.960
 And regular church work and activity, this truth may round out some rough edges, but in other

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.120
 areas, it demands radical transformation

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.520
 Equipped with this one maxim, we may curb the commercialization of Christianity and usher

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.240
 in a new era of uncompromised ministry

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.200
 In the context of Gospel proclamation, accepting support as anything other than an active

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.640
 co-labor, compromises the sincerity of ministry

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.640
 The modern church has unintentionally gone astray, blindly following the model of the world

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.920
 What blessings await if we will reform our practices, calling ministers and ministries to repentance?

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.800
 Its heads give judgment for a bribe, its priests teach for a price, its prophets practice

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.040
 divination for money, yet they lean on the Lord and say, "It's not the Lord in the midst

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.360
 of us, no disaster shall come upon us,"

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.880
 Micah 311

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.880
 End of conclusion

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:10.880
