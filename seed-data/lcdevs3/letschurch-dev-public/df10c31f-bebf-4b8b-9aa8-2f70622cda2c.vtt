00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.220
 The Dorian Principle, a biblical response to the commercialization of Christianity by

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.960
 Conley Owens, Appendix B, Copyright in the United States.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.920
 And the United States, Copyright applies to original works fixed in a tangible medium

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.800
 of expression.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.360
 It may additionally apply to various artistic works, but does not protect facts or inventions.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.600
 Works exist under copyright protection the moment they are fixed in a tangible form.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.280
 One may register a work with the U.S. Copyright Office, but this registration is unnecessary

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.280
 to establish protection only to assist in the event of litigation.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.520
 Copyright protection provides the copyright holder with exclusive rights to reproduce the

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.360
 original work, make derivative works, distribute copies of a work, or to display or perform

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.840
 that work publicly.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.280
 However, fair use doctrine allows for segments of a protected work to be copied and distributed

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.760
 for purposes such as criticism.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.000
 Copyright protection lasts for the life of the author plus an additional 70 years.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.280
 For anonymous works or works made for hire, it typically endures for 95 years from initial

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.880
 publication.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.880
 The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, DMCA, enacted in 1998, provides additional protections

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.600
 or limitations on digital works.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.640
 Because digital works often includes some copy protection mechanism, the DMCA makes it

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.500
 illegal to circumvent these mechanisms or disseminate tools intended to circumvent these

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.240
 mechanisms.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.680
 Additionally, the DMCA makes it illegal to link to infringing content.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.560
 As many service providers, e.g. online video sites, OSContin uploaded by users, the DMCA

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.720
 offers a provision to grant safe harbor for such utilities provided they comply with

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.520
 regulations designed to prevent copyright infringement.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.320
 Of course, there are many details and edge cases not covered in this brief summary.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.480
 Furthermore, copyright law in the United States has a varied history, so these rules do not

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.080
 apply uniformly to works authored in the past.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.080
