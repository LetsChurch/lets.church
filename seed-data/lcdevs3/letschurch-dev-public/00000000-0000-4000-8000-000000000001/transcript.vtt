00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720
 The Dorian Principle, a biblical response to the commercialization of Christianity by

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.200
 Conley Owens, introduction, a call for discernment.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.720
 Consider the sheer quantity of wealth that changes hands in the name of Christ.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.000
 Christian book sales climb into the hundreds of millions of dollars, parachurch ministries,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.440
 mass size revenues with organizations like Cruz are passing $600 million.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.840
 Seminaries often collect tuition upwards of $60,000 for a standard degree, with loan payments

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.960
 leaving many pastors financially shackled for years.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.560
 Even small dollar transactions impose their own heavy burdens.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.280
 For example, church leaders exhaust countless hours, wrestling to understand and purchase

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.240
 the appropriate licenses to worship music in order to accommodate the needs of their

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.240
 congregation.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.800
 Certainly money fuels the work of ministry, and the workers worthy of his wages, 1 Timothy

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.800
 518.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.920
 But at what point does the financial enterprise go too far?

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.440
 The modern church lacks the moral parameters necessary to identify ethical transgressions

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.680
 in ministry fundraising.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.720
 Of course, who wouldn't object to the money-grubbing solicitations of prosperity gospel preachers

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.240
 and aberrant televangelists?

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.680
 But our judgment must extend beyond the ability to detect the most egregious infractions.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.760
 In a context where biblical discernment is limited, ministry leaders operate without guidance

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.840
 or real accountability.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.280
 Now more than ever, the church must turn to the word of God to find wisdom on these matters

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.240
 and develop the clarity required for true discernment.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.320
 The goal of this brief book is to establish the Dorian Principle, a biblical precept that

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.840
 distinguishes ethical ministry fundraising from unethical ministry fundraising.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.320
 The Dorian Principle characterizes godly financial activity in the name of the gospel and acts

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.440
 of co-labor and contra distinction to acts of reciprocity.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.200
 Ministry should be supported, not sold.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.160
 The primary instruction comes from the words of Jesus, Paul, and other apostles as they

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.280
 teach the Dorian Principle.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.280
 The early church corroborates our findings by practicing in accord with its sticktates.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.200
 Finally, we will make some practical applications in Charter Path forward to resist the commercialization

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.600
 of Christianity.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.520
 In the end, I hope this study will be as enlightening for you as it was for me, and that you will

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.000
 find yourself closer to answering the enigma, the inner sex, ministry, and money.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.280
 I write these words in order to address a topic that for too long has not received the attention

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.360
 it deserves, a topic often outright avoided.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.320
 This book is not the final word on the matter, but rather a first attempt at capturing a biblical

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.960
 ethic of ministry fundraising.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.040
 If the Lord chooses to bless this work, it will only be a launching pad for further

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.200
 biblical exploration, application, and discussion.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.560
 May God guide your thoughts as you read.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.440
 One gives freely, yet grows all the richer.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.120
 Another withholds what He should give, and only suffers one, Proverbs 1124.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.000
