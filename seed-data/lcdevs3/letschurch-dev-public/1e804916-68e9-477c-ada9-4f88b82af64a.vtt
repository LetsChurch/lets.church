00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 The Dorian Principle, a biblical response to the commercialization of Christianity by

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:16.240
 Conley Owens, Chapter 12, the Challenge of Parachurch, Help vs. Hurt.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.160
 Nothing makes for an exciting hero like a vigilante.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.840
 Fed up with the inefficiencies or corruptions of governing authorities, Azele's hero

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.040
 goes outside the purview of the law to take matters of justice into his own hands.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.900
 He captures and punishes criminals unencumbered by red tape and crooked bureaucrats, fueled

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.880
 by righteous indignation, he restores order in the world.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.560
 It's no wonder fictional characters like Robin Hodo and Batman, Garner Mass Appeal,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.400
 and reality, however, vigilante justice is often problematic, rarely guided by a careful

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:02.360
 weighing of the matter, psychological instability or mob mentality typically provokes such activity.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.960
 Even those who do operate with some sense of rationality frequently commit grave errors

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.400
 by baddening the safeguards as civil government.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.400
 There is a reason the phrase kangaroo court does not ring with positive connotations.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.840
 In a sense, the church has her own set of vigilantes.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.520
 When Jesus established God's heavenly kingdom on earth, he decided to operate through a franchise

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.160
 of local institutions he called the church, Assemblies constituted with particular offices

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.800
 and functions.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.520
 Many have found this structure inefficient, often to establish their own institutions to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.240
 accomplish religious ends, widely known as parachurch organizations.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.720
 Many of these ministries may be accompanied by the excitement of fictional vigilantes,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.840
 but they often encounter problems similar to the ones faced by real world vigilantes.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.560
 I don't write all this to challenge the legitimacy of parachurch ministries, but to call

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.280
 attention to the fact that they introduce their own complications, especially when it comes

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.880
 to ministry fundraising.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.880
 Since they cannot rely on the fundraising practice of the church, they tend to create new

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.040
 avenues of support that potentially violate the Dory Imprinciple.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.720
 In this chapter, I would like to offer a quick overview of where exactly the issues lie

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:34.040
 and how a healthy focus on the local church may circumvent them.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.320
 Church identity versus parachurch identity.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.440
 The church is that body of believers Christ instituted to represent his kingdom on earth.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.760
 The universal church is composed of all Christians everywhere, while the local church refers to

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.400
 a particular society of Christians characterized by their regular gathering for worship.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.080
 Ethemologically, parah indicates coming alongside of something.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.760
 Parachurch ministry is simply any ministry regulated outside of the local church whose primary

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.520
 goal is to ate the church with their local or universal.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.680
 Thus, while the label is typically used for organizations like Intervarsity Christian Fellowship

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.920
 or Compassion International, broadly, it applies even to individuals operating outside the

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.240
 structure of the local church with the intent to serve the church.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.880
 Church structure versus parachurch structure.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.120
 The essential distinction between the local church and the parachurch lies in structure.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.840
 Sending this distinction is the key to recognizing the potential pitfalls of parachurch entities,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.960
 especially as related to the Dorian Principle.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.800
 Let's look at this structure according to the Bible's breakdown of a church.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.000
 The congregation, elders, and deacons.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.360
 The congregation is the membership of a church.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.200
 While some churches do not practice formal membership, there is generally an understanding

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.360
 of who is permitted to participate in the Lord's Supper on a regular basis.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.960
 The congregation ultimately forms the primary source of accountability in the church.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.200
 Even if the church does not practice congregational voting, the people vote with their feet, joining

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.760
 and supporting those ministries which operate as they see fit.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.080
 Parachurch ministries rarely have similarly defined membership, or even similarly defined

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.280
 goals.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.200
 The elders of a church watch over a congregation, managing the teaching of the church and leading

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.960
 it into discerning doctrinal issues.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.080
 Ideally, a body of elders would consider church fundraising practices in light of the

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.560
 word of God with especially discerning eyes.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.240
 Parachurch organizations typically guarantee no such oversight.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.520
 The deacons of a church have authority over the physical resources of the church to meet

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.200
 the physical needs of the church.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.600
 The Bible requires they conform to the standard set in 1 Timothy 3, 8, through 13.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.200
 Outside the church, those who take on similar roles may be vetted spiritually, but are rarely

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.240
 assessed by the same rubric.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.480
 In all these, secular positions replace sacred ones.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.360
 The structure that protects the ethical collection of resources in the church rarely exists in

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.480
 other organizations, nor can it ever completely.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.080
 In adding such church structures, a parachurch organization would cease to exist as such, and

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.440
 would simply become a church.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.640
 Church fundraising versus parachurch fundraising.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.560
 The Bible establishes a model of fundraising for the church, the voluntary contributions

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.240
 of the congregation.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.960
 Presuming they are offered in an effort to co-labor with the church, they perfectly accord

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.400
 with the Dorian Principle.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.760
 We see these contributions first in Acts, where the people pool their resources.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.720
 Acts 2, 44 to 345.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.560
 To be distributed by the apostles, functioning as elders.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.400
 Acts 4, 34 to 335.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.760
 And later, a body known as the Seventh, functioning as deacons.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.520
 Acts 6, 1 through 3.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.800
 Elsewhere, Paul commands the church in Corinth to contribute weekly on the first day of every

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.960
 week.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.200
 In Acts 6, 1 through 2.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:36.120
 In contrast, the Bible prescribes no source of income for parachurch organizations.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:43.160
 Consequently, the exigencies of ministry drive them toward innovative fundraising practices,

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.120
 frequently creating opportunities to transgress the Dorian Principle.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:53.400
 While not exclusive to parachurch institutions, there is a reason the sale of ministry occurs

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.480
 more frequently outside the church than inside the church.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:03.020
 Book sales cover author commission, conference tickets cover speaker fees, tuition payments

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:10.000
 cover tenured salaries, and proprietary licenses cover musician paychecks.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.040
 Yet by and large, the voluntary contributions of the congregation suffice for church-employed

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.360
 ministers.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.160
 Alternative approaches.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.400
 Parachurch entities typically form for the sake of expediency.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.120
 The alternatives deemed too inefficient or ineffective.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.760
 However, in light of the Dorian Principle, we should consider several alternatives to

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.040
 the practices of parachurch ministries.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.480
 Moving from more to less aggressive measures, the following three strategies provide potential

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:52.720
 replacements for standard parachurch practices that abandon the Dorian Principle.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.560
 Conducting ministry under the auspices of the local church.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.120
 Many parachurch endeavors could directly translate to church endeavors.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.960
 Such ministry would be subject to the authority structure of the church and receive its funding

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.480
 directly from the church.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.840
 The governance of a parachurch entity that seems too large or has too many stakeholders

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.360
 to fit within a single church could potentially be subdivided or franchise to be run by multiple

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.800
 churches.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.200
 Not only would this work for many sophisticated organizations, but it would work especially

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.280
 well for ministries of individuals.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.120
 For pastors and other staff, churches could recognize their special labor in their regular

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.600
 salary.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.560
 For others, nothing inhibits the church from creating a position for them.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:44.480
 For example, some churches have a scholar and residence position that could be appropriately

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.160
 compensated.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.320
 Christian authors who produce valuable teaching ought to be supported so that they have

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:56.480
 the liberty to write without fearing the financial ramifications of abandoning their day

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.800
 job.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:03.720
 However, a number of Christian authors write and publish books independent of the authority

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.640
 structure and financing of their church.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.600
 In the end, they frequently support their work by selling their finished product, some

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.720
 even priding themselves for doing so.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:21.000
 To draw examples from the spectrum of evangelicalism, Rick Warren and Joel Osteen have both

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.440
 opted out of taking any income from their churches instead living primarily on book royalties.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:34.400
 However, this swaps co-labor with reciprocity, reversing the Dorian principle.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:39.640
 They proudly reject co-labor and happily accept reciprocity.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:44.040
 The church that wishes to co-labor with the minister should be permitted to do so, and

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.880
 none should be asked to purchase ministry through book sales or otherwise.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.600
 In contrast, some have commendably offered their works for free, rejecting royalties from

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:59.520
 hard copy sales, living only on the support provided by their churches.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.680
 John Piper is an example of one such minister.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.840
 Fundraising through church partnerships.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.920
 Those paraturch organizations which receive their funding largely from individuals could limit

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.400
 their solicitations to established churches.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.880
 By receiving money from churches that wished to partner with them, they would rely only

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:27.200
 on the voluntary contribution of congregations rather than the sale of religious instruction.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.200
 Prefunding.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:34.080
 Rather than attempting to recoup costs after the fact via ticket and literature sales,

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.680
 paraturch organizations could prefund their ministry.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.640
 For example, religious conference organizers could work with churches and individuals to

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:48.520
 collect money to support the teachers rather than doing so through ticket sales.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:54.000
 Similarly, rather than relying on book sales, Christian publishing houses could work with

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.760
 churches and individuals to establish joint fund from which authors would be paid.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:05.200
 Instead of one entity shouldering all the risk and potentially turning a financial profit,

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.920
 many believers were partnered together in sharing the risk, praying together for a spiritual

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.480
 harvest.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.720
 Crown funding utilities such as Kickstarter or Patreon offer a viable alternative to the

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.280
 work first, receive later model of the publishing industry.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.960
 With these tools, one may receive funds from partners on a regular basis or raise money

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.760
 for a ministry endeavor prior to commencing.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.360
 These approaches would give Christian ministers a way to raise support from those genuinely

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:41.160
 interested in supporting the ministry without appealing directly to those who are the main

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.400
 targets of the ministry.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.720
 However, a word of caution.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.920
 Crown funding utilities often encourage offering perks at different donation levels, and the

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:59.320
 context of ministry, such seeming bribery does not accord with the Dorian principle.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.320
 Seminaries

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:07.400
 As a case study, a particular category of parachurch organization supplies here.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.560
 Seminaries typically operate outside of the direct oversight of the local church, but

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.360
 have significant impact on the church at large.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.760
 While financial aid programs exist, rarely does one complete a seminary degree apart from

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.040
 incurring substantial costs.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:30.600
 As an example, reformed theological seminary presently charges tuition at typical rates.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:41.560
 At $585 per semester hour, for a 106 hour master of divinity degree, that totals to $62,010.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:46.160
 Not counting the additional host of fees that go beyond rural tuition.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.880
 Even that seminary education constitutes religious instruction in nearly the purest sense, the

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:57.280
 Dorian principle demands that seminaries not accept money from their students in exchange.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:04.400
 However, rather than destroying these institutions, several options compatible with the Dorian principle

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.600
 offer ways to preserve them.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.140
 Rather than raising money through tuition, seminaries could be funded by individuals and

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.540
 churches looking to support the work of the school.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:21.940
 For example, such an institution does not have to directly salary their instructors, but

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.820
 could instead provide a framework for churches to support them.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:32.260
 These issues of staff largely exhaust our concerns since the Dorian principle does not necessarily

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.500
 regulate student room and board.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:40.500
 For brick and mortar seminaries, compliance with the biblical ethic may largely reside

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:46.440
 in delineating facility costs from staff costs, ensuring the latter is funded through responsibly

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.340
 sourced donations.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:53.840
 However, the advent of online seminaries offers a new way forward with little concern

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.780
 for physical resources.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:01.620
 In fact, several of these seminaries have adopted a similar model, with virtually all faculty

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:06.220
 receiving no compensation directly from the seminary.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:11.060
 For example, the law college and seminary and forged theological seminary both provide

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:16.520
 free education through removing the financial burden of a physical campus, choosing educational

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:22.940
 material that minimizes costs and relying on the support of volunteer faculty.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:28.380
 These individuals often receive support for their work from their own churches, who understand

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:32.460
 their academic efforts to be an aspect of their ministry.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:39.140
 By structuring themselves this way, these institutions relegate spiritual formation and other time-intensive

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:44.020
 aspects of seminary life to the local church.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.460
 While this trend represents a radical shift from the traditional model, it promotes the

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:55.100
 primacy of the local church and, consequently, compliance with the Dorian principle.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:59.420
 As more seminaries follow this model, we may hope that a free education will become the

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:03.420
 norm of pastoral training.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:08.220
 Conferences As an additional case study, gospel themed

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:12.340
 conferences likewise collect large sums of money from attendees.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:18.260
 Non-uncommonly, organizers sell tickets at a cost approximating $100 a day.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:25.260
 For example, together for the Gospels T4G20 was a three-day exclusive livestream event

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:29.660
 with registration costing $299.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:35.220
 At thousands in attendance, this represents over $1 million in ticket sales.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:40.460
 If the purpose of such events is truly to promote the gospel, then the Dorian principle must

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.860
 shape its commerce.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:49.100
 Naturally, large events require substantial sums of money to reserve venues, print conference

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.900
 materials, etc.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:56.660
 Thus, it is not surprising that fees are often associated with conference attendance.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:03.580
 However, according to our ethic, one should not charge for the actual ministry of the gospel.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:09.380
 A key issue here is that in conference tickets, material costs are rarely delineated from

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.420
 the cost of the instruction itself.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:17.540
 When they are, it becomes apparent whether or not the organizers intend to sell religious

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.700
 instruction to the audience.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:25.100
 For example, in order to avoid the suggestion that the teaching itself is being sold, a ticket

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.540
 could be labeled a meal in facilities pass.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:33.700
 Regardless, our ethic also regulates all that directly attends to the proclamation of the

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.700
 word.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:39.860
 So gospel-centric event organizers should consider finding willing co-laborers rather than

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.020
 charging for attendance.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.780
 Conclusion

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.860
 This paraturch ministry lacks the structure of the church.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:55.020
 It opens itself to additional opportunities to violate the Dorian principle.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:17:00.020
 Most notably, it lacks the regular contributions of the saints, and so frequently resorts

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.700
 to creative fundraising measures.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.980
 These measures often cross the line set by the Dorian principle.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:13.140
 Recognizing the tacit dangers of paraturch ministry, we should respond proactively, finding

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:17.740
 ways to generate support through co-labor rather than reciprocity.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:22.980
 Where possible, we should even consider restructuring paraturch activities under the auspices

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.700
 of the church.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:26.700
