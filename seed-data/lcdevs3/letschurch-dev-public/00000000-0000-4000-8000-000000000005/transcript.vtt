00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.720
 The Dorian Principle, a Biblical response to the commercialization of Christianity by

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:19.840
 Conley Owens, Chapter 4, the burden of support, difficulty versus obligation.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.400
 I've always enjoyed telling riddles.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.120
 It's one of my favorite pastimes.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.360
 Others might inform you that I enjoy torturing people with riddles.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.560
 Once I've started the enigma, I refuse to give hints beyond answers to yes or no questions.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.480
 Whenever a brave soul agrees to this experience, the first riddle I usually tell goes like

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 this.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.280
 "Jo is afraid to go home because the man with the mask is there.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.280
 Where's Jo?"

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.280
 I'd prefer to let you struggle to determine the answer through carefully thought-out questions,

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.240
 but despite advances in technology, I cannot do that through this book.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.440
 I will just have to tell you the answer.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.080
 Third base.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.600
 Jo is a baseball player afraid of stealing home base because the mask catcher protects

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.440
 the plate.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.880
 The fun of this particular riddle lies in the fact that the hero typically imagines a scene

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.160
 from a horror movie.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.400
 What hidden villain awaits Jo at his house?

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.800
 Usually, it isn't until the end of the process that the riddle solver begins to reorient his

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.560
 thinking around other scenarios such as sports.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.720
 Similar to the diversion of this riddle, when Paul speaks of burdening his churches through

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.560
 ministry fundraising, people often assume his concern revolves around the notion of imposed

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.560
 difficulty.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.200
 He does not accept money because he wishes to avoid placing undue hardships on anyone.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.720
 However, our investigation from the previous chapter in the various triangle diagrams we

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.520
 developed should lead us to wonder whether he instead speaks of imposed obligation.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.920
 In this chapter, we will examine how Paul uses the notion of burden to describe his financial

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.320
 disposition toward three churches, the Church of Philippi, the Church of Thessalonica, and

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.520
 the Church of Corinth.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.120
 As we do, we will see that Paul's mentions of burden do not primarily refer to difficulty,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.880
 but to a direct obligation between man and minister that contends with an obligation

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.760
 mediated by God.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.800
 Corinth and Thessalonica

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.800
 Paul occasionally uses the word burden to explain his refusal of funds from the Corinthians

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.360
 and Thessalonians.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.200
 For in what were you less favored than the rest of the churches, except that I myself

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.320
 did not burden you.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.360
 Forgive me this wrong.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.760
 Here for the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden, for I seek

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.560
 not what is yours, but you.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.840
 For children are not obligated to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.080
 For you remember brothers, our labor and toil, we work night and day that we might not be

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.520
 a burden to any of you while we proclaim to you the gospel of God.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.000
 Versesalonians 2.9

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.960
 For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not idle when we were with

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.960
 you.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.560
 Nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with toil and labor we work night

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.320
 and day that we might not be a burden to any of you.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.320
 2.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.320
 Thessalonians 3.7.8

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.400
 Specifically, Paul claims that his refusal of Corinthian and Thessalonian support stems

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.160
 from his unwillingness to burden them.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.720
 A common understanding of these verses says that Paul does not wish to impose undue hardship

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.560
 on these churches.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.560
 Certainly the word "burden" frequently emphasizes difficulty, but the picture complexifies

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.800
 when set in contrast the apostles' disposition toward the Church of Philippi.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.840
 Philippi

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.440
 Writing to the Corinthians, Paul hyperbobbly claims that he has robbed the churches

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.680
 of Macedonia in order to avoid burdening them.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.400
 I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you, and when I was

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.040
 with you and was in need I did not burden anyone for the brothers who came from Macedonia

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.920
 supplied my need.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.720
 So I refrained and will refrained from burdening you in any way.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.720
 2.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.920
 Corinthians 11.8.3.9

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:36.000
 When writing to the Church in Philippi, the most prominent church in Macedonia, Paul confirms

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.760
 that no other supported him.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.720
 And you Philippians, yourselves, know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.640
 no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.760
 Another hint that Paul received Philippian aid appears in Acts when Silas and Timothy

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.760
 join him for Macedonia.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.240
 Though Paul had been working as a tentmaker, Acts 183, and reasoning from Scripture only

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:13.080
 on the Sabbath, Acts 184, he began to preach full time when they arrived, Acts 185.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.340
 This seems to imply that Paul's companions arrive with finances from Macedonia so that

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.640
 he no longer needs to work.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:29.040
 Not only in Corinth, but also in Thessalonica, Paul receives aid from Philippi, Philippians

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.720
 225, 416-18.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.440
 So why this disparity between Philippi and Corinth slashed Thessalonica?

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.360
 Burden as difficulty

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.640
 If we entertain the idea that Paul does not wish to impose on New hardship, then we might

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.320
 conclude that the churches of Corinth and Thessalonica are impoverished compared to the

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.480
 church in Philippi.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.320
 This position is, however, untenable.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.000
 Nothing suggests uniform poverty among the Corinthians.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.600
 Instead we see that they were mixed socially.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.920
 When Paul says that not many are of noble birth, 1 Corinthians 126, he implies that some

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.920
 are.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:21.720
 Additionally, we see that there are some who are well off 1 Corinthians 1121.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:28.000
 The Mediterranean area as a whole economically boomed during the 1st century.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.680
 Philippi, on the other hand, evidences more signs of poverty.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.360
 Paul describes the Philippians as giving beyond their means, 2 Corinthians 8 4, and Paul

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.000
 goes as far as to describe it as robbery to take money from them.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.200
 2 Corinthians 11 8.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.040
 If either the church in Corinth or Philippi could be charged with the pinnury, it would

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.120
 be the Philippian church.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.240
 More importantly, with his repeated emphasis on sacrificial giving, the Apostles seems

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.120
 to have no prohibition on receiving funds from those who would find it economically difficult

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.080
 to give.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.600
 As we have already seen, he repeatedly expresses a willingness to receive financially from

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.240
 the Corinthians in the form of propimpo support.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.320
 Yet considers this no undue hardship.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.680
 The notion of burden then must indicate something other than difficulty.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.440
 Burden as obligation.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:33.520
 In each instance, where Paul expresses an unwillingness to burden the Corinthians or Thessalonians,

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:40.280
 he refers to the act of receiving support particularly in the context of initial ministry.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.920
 After he speaks of his labor to avoid burdening the Thessalonians, the Apostle describes

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:53.800
 himself as a father of young children, Thessalonians 211, a denercing mother, Thessalonians 277.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.320
 This language of immaturity indicates the Thessalonians' initial conversion and contrast

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.640
 to their existence as an established church.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:08.720
 Undoubtedly, Paul refers to the same incident when he mentions burdens in 2 Thessalonians

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.000
 3-8.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.720
 Paul also speaks of the Corinthians as his children, but more importantly, he recalls

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.720
 how the signs of an Apostle were performed when he first avoided burdening the Corinthians.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.760
 2 Corinthians 12-12-13.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.840
 This presumably refers to his initial arrival.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.680
 On the other hand, Paul never considers it a burden when he accepts money from firmly

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.800
 established churches.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.960
 He does not say that he burdened other churches so that he would not burden the Corinthians,

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.640
 but that he did not burden anyone at all.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.360
 2 Corinthians 11-9.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.160
 In other words, his reception of money from the more established Philippian church does

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.840
 not count as a burden, even though he robbed them.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.640
 2 Corinthians 11-8.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.360
 On its face, 2 Corinthians 12-13 may suggest otherwise.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:14.160
 Or in what were you less favored than the rest of the churches, except that I myself did

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.160
 not burden you.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:22.140
 But the irony present in the verse more likely only indicates that his non-burdensome actions

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:27.320
 toward the other churches would count as burdens if applied to the Corinthians.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.720
 Besides, it would be difficult to justify the Apostle's behavior if he actually did treat

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:38.560
 his congregations with partiality, C.F. James 2-1.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:44.880
 But why does it matter that circumstances of initial ministry correlate to Paul's concern?

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.760
 Quite simply, new converts are likely to offer money in exchange for the gospel.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:56.320
 Thus, Paul tells the Corinthians that if he were to accept their offer, his preaching

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.280
 would no longer be free of charge.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:04.520
 One who pays for ministry incurs burden because the whole notion of payment presumes some

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.520
 sort of debt, something that is owed.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.920
 In other words, Paul uses the word "burden" to refer to the direct obligation imposed

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.520
 by ministerial reciprocity.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:21.640
 This becomes more apparent in another verse where he uses one of the same creed cruts,

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.160
 "Barros," to speak of demands.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.520
 In order to seek glory from people, whether from you or from others, though we could have

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.520
 made demands as apostles of Christ.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.800
 Verse Scyloneans 2-6.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.560
 To be clear, Paul does not employ some special protocol to reject money on initial visits

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.120
 and accept it on others.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.800
 Neither does he reject money while he is with a congregation and accept it while he is

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.160
 away.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:57.320
 On the contrary, he willingly receives from the first Philippian he evangelizes, Acts 1615,

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.200
 CF, Philippians 1-5.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.400
 And he indefinitely continues to reject the Corinthians gift.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.600
 Verse Corinthians 9-15.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.120
 Second Corinthians 11-12.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.760
 He rejects support most frequently in the context of initial visits, but that is because

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:21.040
 reciprocity is most frequently offered in the context of an initial visit.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:27.600
 The apostle only receives support as co-labor, and when he arrives in an unavangelized area,

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.800
 there are rarely co-laborers to be found.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.040
 Philippian partnership.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.720
 In contrast to the passages we have examined regarding the Corinthians and Thessalonians,

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.320
 Paul willingly receives from the Philippians.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:50.480
 As you might guess, rather than reciprocity, there are offerings of material support constitute

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.480
 co-labor.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:58.560
 Paul especially evidences this co-labor by his use of the Greek word "coinonia", often

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.760
 translated as fellowship or partnership.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:08.240
 Coinonia frequently refers to functional partnerships rather than merely the mutual trust

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.320
 that corresponds to such partnerships.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:19.160
 For example, Luke uses it to speak of a business cooperative between fishermen, Luke 510.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.840
 So when the apostle repeats this word in his epistle to the Philippians describing their

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:29.400
 mutual relationship, the concept of a joint business venture should color our understanding

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.640
 of their contribution.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:38.000
 Additionally, the unparalleled commercial terms used in Philippians 410-20 indicate that

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.840
 the Philippians do not offer a gift to Paul so much as a shared resource for achieving gospel-oriented

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.680
 purposes.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:53.840
 In other words, they operate as investors, funding a skilled labor and a common enterprise.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:59.160
 Since they both aim for promotion of the gospel, their transaction does not imply a direct

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:06.040
 obligation to Paul, and thus is not characterized by necessity or by proportional exchange.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:11.880
 Those who share the same Lord organically work together to pursue the same goals.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:18.320
 Notably, Julian and Agarou and what is likely the most advanced study on the relationship

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.920
 between Paul and the Philippians reaches the same conclusions.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.880
 Regarding the mutuality of the relationship, he writes that rather than exchanging finances

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:34.440
 slash goods, slash services, Paul and the Philippians contribute to a common fund.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.640
 And that in this model, the contributions need not have been of equal amount or similar

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.240
 kind.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.560
 In other words, the typical quid pro quo exchange of reciprocity is absent.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:52.560
 Rather, Paul and the Philippians labor together, the Philippians supplying venture capital

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.600
 and Paul supplying skill, time, and energy.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.440
 This resolves an additional mystery about the book of Philippians.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.720
 Why the thankless thanks?

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.560
 That is, Paul writes this letter on the occasion of receiving aid from the Philippians while

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.920
 imprisoned, Philippians 1-14-4-10.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:17.320
 Yet not until the very end of the epistle does he directly acknowledge their contribution,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.080
 Philippians 4-10-20.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:25.720
 Even then, rather than highlighting the blessing it is to impersonally, he emphasizes his

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.560
 sufficiency without it, Philippians 4-11-13.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:36.280
 The notion of co-labor illuminates the apostles otherwise unexpected behavior.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:40.720
 The epistle lacks the typical gratitude of a thank you letter, because rather than

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.280
 giving to Paul, the Philippians give primarily to God.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.520
 The apostle commends them for their faithfulness in the matter of his poverty, but their shared

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.920
 purpose is greater than his own well-being.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.480
 And the words of David Ibrionis.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:02.920
 Paul's merely pass on the commodity of another as mediators or mutual brokers.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:08.600
 In this way, both mediating parties equally share a vertical tie of obligation to God,

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:14.960
 which partly, though not completely, disentangles the horizontal ties of obligation to each other.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:20.360
 Put simply, because of the divine third party, obligation ceases to be primarily between

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.720
 Paul and the Philippians.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:29.320
 Rionis reckons Paul and the Philippians as mediating parties exchanging resources, gifts originating

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:35.080
 from God being given to one at the hands of the other, but tacitly identifies God as

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:40.280
 mediating the obligation between the two.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:46.920
 Paul's description of the Philippians' gift as sacrifice solidifies this mediated obligation.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.440
 I have received full payment and more.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:54.960
 I am well supplied, having received from a path for dietest the gifts you sent, a fragrant

00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:01.320
 offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God, Philippians 4.18.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:06.840
 While the Philippians render material support ultimately to Paul, the religious term sacrifice

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:12.240
 indicates that, in a more immediate sense, they render it to God.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:17.680
 Just as Old Testament Israel sacrificed to God by giving to his priests, the New Testament

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.880
 church often sacrifices to God by giving to his ministers.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.960
 Conclusion The Dorian Principle resolves this problem of burden

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:32.160
 nicely, contrasting reciprocity with co-labor.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:38.760
 If the Corinthians or Thessalonians exchange material support for the gospel, they implicitly

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:44.000
 acknowledge themselves indebted to the gospel per claimer, burdened.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.760
 However, if Paul anticipates or even expects their co-labor, he does not burden them because

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.400
 he suggests no direct obligation to himself.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:17:02.600
 Instead, they find themselves directly obligated to Christ, one whose burden is light, Matthew

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.120
 1130.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.560
 This conclusion aligns with Paul's consistent use of this term in the active voice.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:16.640
 He is concerned that he will burden them, not that they may be burdened in general.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:22.040
 Those who offer support as co-labor may give out of their obligation to God, but the Apostle

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.800
 lays no burden on anyone, including the Philippians.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.840
 End of chapter 4
