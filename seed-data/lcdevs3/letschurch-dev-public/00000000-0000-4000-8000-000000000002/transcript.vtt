00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400
 The Dorian Principle of Biblical response to the commercialization of Christianity by

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.800
 Conley Owens Chapter 1, the command of Christ, reciprocity

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.440
 versus codelabor.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.120
 When I was six years old, I had a King James Version Bible with the words of Christ marked

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:31.920
 in red. So many pages consisted only of dull black, so when I would arrive at those pages

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.040
 with crimson verses, I felt that I had stumbled upon a great treasure.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.080
 Years later, I learned that the gospels were not originally printed in books with color

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:50.600
 or other typographic novelties, but simply penned in whatever ink was available.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.520
 Moreover, as I matured, I recognized that if the apostles and prophets were a thwartate

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.760
 of messengers sent by God, then the black letters carry all the same weight as the red.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.680
 That is not to say I hadn't stumbled upon a great treasure. Just as certain miracles

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.600
 were reserved for Christ to perform, John 932, certain messages were reserved for him

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:23.800
 to proclaim, "Where best to begin, but with the words of the Master." Luke and Matthew,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.240
 When you consider the financial maintenance of ministers, what passage first comes to mind?

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.160
 If you have studied the Bible for any significant amount of time, it's likely you landed on

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.840
 the phrase in the middle of Luke 107. The labor is worthy of his wages.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.960
 Why this particular phrase? One, it is undeniably catchy. In fact, this adage was already

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.760
 a traditional proverb by the time that Christ first uttered it.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:00.120
 Two, it formed the basis for Paul's understanding of the same topic, 1 Timothy 518.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.600
 The apostles ethic is little more than an extensive application of Christ's command.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.200
 3 Timothy 3, it represents the first clear teaching on the matter offered at the dawn of

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.200
 Christian ministry.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:22.160
 3, however, if you take a look at the passage, you will discover that Luke places this instruction

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:30.320
 alongside the sending out of the 70 disciples, sometime after the sending out of the 12 disciples.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.720
 Although a useful starting point, it would be better to travel back a little further in

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.480
 time and see what Jesus said to the original 12.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.280
 In God's Providence, Matthew records this for us, albeit, in a phrase that garners less

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.920
 popular recognition. The labor deserves his food.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.960
 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You receive without paying,

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.980
 give without pay. Acquire no gold or silver or copper for your belts, no bag for your

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.980
 journey, or two tunics, or sandals, or a staff, for the labor deserves his food.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.980
 Matthew 10, 8-10.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:23.980
 Food in Matthew 10-10 coincides with wages and Luke 10-7. It makes little practical difference

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.860
 if a traveling disciple receives a denarius or a denarius' worth of bread. Both count

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.420
 as compensation for the work done. From this extended imperative in Matthew 10, we can develop

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:45.620
 an understanding of Christ's teaching on the relationship between money and ministry.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.540
 The Question of Payment.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.180
 Take another look at the passage. Notice anything interesting? It says the disciples are to give

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.040
 without pay. At first glance, this appears to conflict with the idea that the labor

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.260
 deserves his food. Should the labor receive wages or not?

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.680
 It is unthinkable that any coherent speaker, let alone Jesus, the treasure store of wisdom

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:21.220
 himself, would offer two contradictory approaches in the same breath. We must find some way to resolve

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.220
 these polar injunctions to refuse and to receive.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.140
 Before exploring a more fitting resolution, let us first walk through a few less satisfactory

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.420
 options.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.940
 Option 1. Jesus forbids the disciples from taking a miserly approach to their work, but permits

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:49.220
 receiving payment. The phrase "freely give" may seem to indicate encouragement toward offering

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:56.180
 ministry bountifully rather than a prohibition against compensation. However, translations

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:04.220
 that say "give without pay" are not mistaken. The Greek word used here, Dorian, indicates

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:12.100
 the giving of something apart from any remuneration. In a context explicitly concerning money,

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:19.100
 this is the same word Paul uses to describe his gratuitous, "freely offered, preaching."

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.100
 2. Corinthians 117.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:30.460
 Option 2. Jesus forbids the disciples from receiving pay, but permits them to regard themselves

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:37.860
 as worthy of it. This option attempts to maintain the honor of the ministry while denying its

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:46.380
 honorariums. On the contrary, and Luke 107, Jesus says that because laborers deserve wages,

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.900
 they should receive from the one they stay with. Furthermore, the Apostle Paul understands

00:05:52.900 --> 00:06:00.220
 this verse to command the support of ministers. 1 Timothy 517.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:08.640
 Option 3. Jesus forbids the disciples from requiring pay, but permits them to receive pay. That

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.420
 is, the disciples are fit for remuneration only when they are willing to minister without

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:20.540
 it. While this may be an attractive solution, it stands at odds with the actual words of

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:27.460
 the verse. If the disciples may receive payment, why does Jesus tell them to give without

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:37.460
 pay? 4. Jesus forbids the disciples from requesting pay, but permits them to receive

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:44.900
 pay. This proposed solution suffers from the same problems as the preceding option. Moreover,

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.860
 if the disciples may not request payment, why does Jesus tell them to seek out people who

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:58.980
 will receive and support them? 10. 11-14. Luke 10. 5-8.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.940
 Option 5. Jesus forbids the disciples from accepting money, but permits them to receive

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:12.900
 food and lodging. First, this proposal creates an arbitrary distinction in capital, as there

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:20.660
 are no interchange between gold and groceries. Someone who receives one could easily exchange

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:26.860
 it for the other. Additionally, the solution fails to address the explicit reference to

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:33.380
 money in Matthew 10-9. The disciples are to rely on others for their financial needs.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:41.220
 In fact, by all accounts, the Apostle Paul regards this passage as promoting monetary support.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:49.420
 16-15-18. Option 6. Jesus forbids the disciples from receiving payment

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:56.820
 and exchange from miracles, but permits them to receive payment and exchange for preaching.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:03.540
 This option wrongly suggests that the disciples might work wonders apart from any proclamation

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:10.620
 of the gospel. The disciples are to give freely because they have received freely. They

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.620
 have not received miraculous healings, but the good news of the Kingdom of God.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:25.220
 17-17. Jesus forbids the disciples from receiving excess profit, but permits them to receive

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:31.620
 that which meets their needs. Such a mediating approach fails to satisfy either

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:39.900
 pole of inquiry. Regarding the command not to receive pay, it allows compensation. Regarding

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:45.020
 the statement that a minister is worthy of his wages, it implicitly denies he deserves

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.940
 anything more than bare sustenance.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:56.500
 8-8. Jesus forbids the disciples from acquiring greedily, but permits them to receive with

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:03.820
 pure motives. While similar to the previous option, this proposal offers an ethic of

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:11.100
 motivation rather than an ethic of moderation. That is, rather than regulating the disciples'

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:18.860
 external activities, it regulates the desires of the heart. However, nothing in the text

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:27.580
 substantiates this resolution. We need a better option. As is typically the case in interpreting

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:35.300
 scripture, the key to understanding this passage is found in the context.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:44.180
 The source of payment. The primary concern of Matthew 10-8-10 is not what is received

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:52.100
 or how it is received, but from whom it is received. The disciples are not to receive from

00:09:52.100 --> 00:10:00.300
 those to whom they minister. They are to receive from God. The key to all this is found in

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:09.660
 the word laborer. Both Matthew and Luke speak of laborer, being worthy of payment. Yet

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:16.100
 neither author newly introduces this term at this point in their respective gospels.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:22.280
 Rather, they appeal to the words of Christ and the preceding passages where he calls for

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:30.060
 laborers to enter the harvest. Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful,

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:36.980
 but the laborers are few." Therefore, pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:47.500
 laborers into his harvest. Matthew 9-37-38-CF-Fuq-10-2.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:55.020
 The employer of the laborers pays their wages. In this metaphor, the employer is the Lord

00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:03.300
 of the harvest, not the grain. Translating this image to reality, God is the employer,

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:09.660
 not the recipients of the gospel message. While we may be tempted to identify those individuals

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:16.620
 who provide for the disciples as the employers or clients who pay the wages, they are rather

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:24.500
 God's instruments in this kingdom economy. The Lord of the harvest commissions his laborers,

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:31.620
 orchestrating their supply from the grain of the field. This stands in stark contrast to

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:37.980
 the idea that in saying, "The laborer is worthy of his wages." Jesus calls those who receive

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:45.980
 the gospel to offer payment to ministers as their employers or clients. Such a conclusion

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:54.220
 mistakes the grain for God, the harvest for its Lord. According to their commission, the

00:11:54.220 --> 00:12:00.140
 disciples are not at liberty to give their ministry in return for payment, but in the course

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:06.780
 of ministry, they may receive support that God has furnished at the hands of men. In the

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:13.820
 words of John Nolan, "The provision of food is not thought of as coming from those who benefit

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:19.820
 from the ministry, which they identify as worthy ministry. The provision is thought of

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:28.460
 as being arranged by God wherever it might come from at a practical level."

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:35.300
 As a prosody in co-labor, "We are farther on our journey toward the truth, but we are

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:42.740
 still faced with the difficulty of differentiating between payment from men and payment from God. Since

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:48.580
 the disciples receive support at the hands of fellow men and not in packages falling

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:55.900
 from heaven, how does one begin to distinguish the two? How do we articulate the difference

00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:02.500
 between horizontal payment from man to minister and vertical payment from the Lord of the harvest

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.020
 to his laborer?"

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:13.060
 The key here is the notion of obligation. In a purely horizontal exchange, a man finds

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:20.420
 himself obligated to a minister. In a contribution representing a vertical payment from God, some

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:26.700
 other obligation secures the arrangement. I will call these two sorts of transactions,

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:34.580
 ministerial reciprocity and ministerial co-labor, shortening them simply to reciprocity and

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.720
 co-labor.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:44.140
 Ministerial reciprocity, support, material or otherwise given to a minister out of a sense

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:52.220
 of direct obligation for his ministry of the gospel. The term reciprocity describes a

00:13:52.220 --> 00:14:01.620
 contribution offered out of a direct obligation. I.e. one that is not mediated by God. One who

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:08.820
 gives out of direct obligation considers himself primarily beholden to the one who receives.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:14.220
 For example, reciprocity occurs when one gives money to a preacher and exchange for the

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:23.180
 gospel that was preached. This notion includes a symmetric exchanges and voluntary exchanges.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:30.660
 For example, ministerial reciprocity occurs even when only a pittance is offered and even

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:37.220
 when no fee is requested, so long as the giver gives from a sense of indebtedness to the

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.820
 minister.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:48.980
 Ministerial co-labor, support, material or otherwise given by man to a minister out of a sense

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:56.620
 of obligation to God to honor or aid in the proclamation of the gospel.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:02.380
 Unlike the direct sense of obligation involved in reciprocity, co-labor acknowledges

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:08.460
 a mediated obligation. The giver considering himself indebted directly to the Lord and

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:15.140
 through that obligation, binding himself duty bound to give to a minister. I call this

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:21.340
 co-labor because it is the product of fellow servants working toward a common goal of a common

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.500
 employer.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:29.620
 Jesus forbids ministerial reciprocity in Matthew 10/8 when he commands his disciples to give

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:37.460
 without pay. On the other hand, he permits and even promotes ministerial co-labor in

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:45.020
 Matthew 10/9/10 when he instructs the disciples not to bring their own provisions because

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:48.740
 the labor deserves his food.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:55.700
 In the chapters ahead, I will refer to this dual ethic as the Dorian principle. Dorian

00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:04.620
 being the Greek word in Matthew 10/8 translated as freely or without pay.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:11.820
 The Dorian principle and the context of gospel proclamation accepting support as anything

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:17.700
 other than an act of co-labor compromises the sincerity of ministry.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:24.200
 The Dorian principle and the context of gospel proclamation accepting support as anything

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:31.440
 other than an act of co-labor compromises the sincerity of ministry.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:36.520
 Wages as co-labor With these definitions in mind, we can

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:43.040
 move forward to Matthew and Luke and establish that the pattern of support Jesus describes

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.000
 should be regarded as an instance of co-labor.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.360
 First, the disciples are not to receive money from all who benefit from their ministry, but

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:58.280
 are to restrict themselves to the hospitality of one in each city.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:05.280
 Matthew 10/11 Luke 10/7 If they were to gather support more broadly,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.920
 we might imagine a pattern of ministerial reciprocity.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.760
 All recipients in ministry would be counted as owing the disciples, and at least the willing

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.840
 ones would be called to compensate them with their resources.

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:25.560
 However, the selective sources of support indicate that the disciples are not permitted to

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:30.440
 broadly impose direct obligation on those to whom they minister.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:36.680
 Second, an act of co-labor takes place when two servants coordinate their efforts for

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:42.520
 the sake of a common master, and indeed, those who support the disciples share the same

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.320
 master.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:49.840
 While we may only be able to term them citizens of the kingdom of God anachronistically,

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:57.480
 CF Matthew 10/7 Luke 10/9 Those who support the disciples are firmly established among

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.320
 God's people.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:06.960
 Jesus restricts the disciples from going to Gentile or Samaritan territories, Matthew 10/5.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:13.280
 But within each Judean city they visit, they are to find one who is worthy, Matthew 10/11

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:18.960
 and his son of peace Luke 10/6.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:24.300
 This vocabulary indicates one who is already qualified to co-labor for the good of the

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.400
 coming kingdom.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:33.320
 The passage is further evidence the expectation of support from the Judean population through

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:38.440
 an especially strong response to rejection.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:43.640
 To pronounce condemnation, the disciples are to shake the dust off their feet.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:52.280
 Matthew 10/14 Luke 10/11 Thus, Jesus can say it will be better for Sodom and Gomorrah

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:56.680
 on the day of judgment than for those who have rejected the gospel.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:03.760
 Matthew 10/15 Luke 10/1 A parallel command of Christ at the end of

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:08.840
 Luke further demonstrates this principle of co-labor.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:15.120
 He said to them, "But now let the one who has a money bag take it, and likewise a knapsack,

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:23.640
 and let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one, Luke 2236."

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.960
 Before, the disciples were told that they should take no money bag because a labor is worthy

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.040
 of his wages.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.160
 Now they are told that they should take a money bag.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.000
 Certainly, the laborer has not become less worthy.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.520
 On the night of his betrayal, Jesus modifies his earlier command in order to prepare his

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:51.000
 disciples for their imminent journey into a hostile environment.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.680
 Previously, the disciples could venture into new territories and expect to find fellow

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:04.080
 servants of God ready to co-labor with them by providing material support for their mission.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:12.080
 From now on, this expectation would be abandoned and replace with the anticipation of opposition.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:17.160
 In the context of this passage, Jesus warns the disciples of the coming persecution

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:23.160
 at the hands of Jews, but his words apply equally to Gentiles.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:30.280
 But people not for Christ is a people against him, Matthew 1230, Luke 1123.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:37.960
 However, we should hesitate to conclude that Jesus only sought to address overt hostility.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:46.920
 The disciples encountered curious minds more than willing to pay for their services, CF-X-818.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:53.360
 In settings absent of the converted, they found lands potentially ripe for reciprocity,

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.160
 but barren for co-labor.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:02.240
 It seems reasonable to suspect Christ instructed his disciples to carry money bags, not merely

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:08.240
 because they could not predictably expect support, but because they could not even ethically

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.760
 receive it.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:17.800
 Regardless, Jesus' instructions to his disciples in Matthew and Luke fit neatly into a pattern

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.440
 of co-labor.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:26.520
 They are to receive help from those who offer out of service to a common master.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:32.760
 In offering the gospel, they are not to request a commercial exchange from anyone, especially

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:38.080
 not from the broad masses they seek to reach.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.360
 The zeal of Christ.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:46.000
 Before we move away from the red letters to other parts of the New Testament, I would

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:53.400
 like to emphasize just how seriously Jesus regarded the intersection of money and ministry.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:59.880
 In one particular event, recorded by all four gospel authors, Jesus forcefully chased

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.720
 money changers out from the temple.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:15.360
 Matthew 21, 12 through 13, Mark 11, 15 through 17, Luke 19, 45 through 46, John 2, 13 through

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.360
 17.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:23.000
 Clearly, he objected to the misuse of the things of God for the sake of gain, and his disapproval

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.880
 is no small matter.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:31.840
 In fact, the disciples recognize this consuming zeal as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.240
 John 217.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:41.080
 In this vein, Jesus rejected Satan's propositions of material gain.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.200
 Matthew 4, 3, and 9.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.960
 Luke 4, 3.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.560
 He likewise expects his followers to resist temptation rather than compromise for the sake

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.240
 of wealth.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:56.160
 As he himself said, "You cannot serve both God and money."

00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:01.520
 Matthew 6, 24, Luke 16, 13.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:06.400
 The words of Christ are a great treasure.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:12.200
 Beginning there, we have found a distinction between ministerial reciprocity and ministerial

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.200
 co-labor.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:20.240
 The former establishes a direct obligation between man and minister, and the other mediates

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.640
 that obligation through God, the Lord of the harvest.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:31.000
 Popular Theologian, Dei Carson, notes a similar scheme in Matthew 10, 8 through 10.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.040
 Remarking that while the service rendered must not be bought or sold, a church has the duty

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.720
 to provide for its ministers.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:45.520
 He further observes, "This particular arrangement continues, I would be prepared to argue,

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.080
 and the letters of Paul."

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:53.080
 This leads us to another treasure, the writings of the Apostle.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.000
 End of chapter 1.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:04.000
