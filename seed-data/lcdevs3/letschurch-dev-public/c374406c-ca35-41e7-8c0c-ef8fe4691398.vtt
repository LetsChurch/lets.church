00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.720
 The Dorian Principle, a biblical response to the commercialization of Christianity by

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:16.920
 Conley Owens, Chapter 11, The Scope of Ministry, Impunity vs. Jurisdiction.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.440
 One morning on the way to my high school, I was listening to the host of a radio show

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:28.840
 recount the story of a woman who led a band of police officers on a high-speed chase.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.500
 Raising down the interstate, she eventually exited and led the authorities through a suburban

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.500
 area.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.960
 Surprisingly, she neither crashed nor pulled over and surrendered.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.240
 Instead, she peeled into the driveway of her home and ran inside.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.920
 What is it that calls this woman to do this?

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.520
 The radio host accepted answers from callers.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.240
 Did she have a medical emergency?

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.640
 Did she need to use the bathroom?

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.320
 The first caller answered correctly.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.920
 She believed she could not be arrested on her own property.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.880
 However, as the woman learned when the strong arm with the law forcibly entered her home,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.920
 that is not how police jurisdiction works.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.040
 Similarly, many imagine that within their own class of ministry, they may operate within

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.560
 punity outside any kind of stipulations.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.800
 However, just as the Lord reigns over all the earth, the jurisdiction of the Dorian principle

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.280
 extends to all gospel ministries.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.880
 In this chapter, I want to explore the boundaries of this jurisdiction in the context of the church.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.040
 Hopefully, by offering practical application, we will reify the ethic put forward in previous

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.960
 chapters, but I also want to give it shape by attempting to sketch its limitations.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.640
 As we will be referring to this principle more frequently from here to the end of the book,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.760
 I'll restate our biblical ethic of ministry fundraising one more time before we continue.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.920
 In the context of gospel proclamation, accepting support as anything other than an active

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.160
 co-labor compromises the sincerity of ministry.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.560
 Now let's embark on the journey of practical application.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.280
 Defining gospel ministry.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.880
 The Dorian principle begins with the phrase, and the context of gospel ministry.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.000
 Given that our stated principle looks to regulate the work of ministry, we must ask what

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.760
 exactly ministry is, and how far its scope extends.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.080
 Some recent attempts to understand vocation in light of the Bible, bridge the secular

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.960
 sacred divide between the work of ministers and laymen.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.360
 While such attempts may have some merit in seeing gods calling for all walks of life, this

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.200
 blurring of distinctions can only provide confusion for our purposes of defining boundaries.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.720
 There must be some activities that are particularly ministry, and some that are discernibly not

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.480
 ministry.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.840
 Otherwise, our principle would reject all commercial exchanges.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.920
 As it starting point, the Apostle Paul's concerns regarding ministry fundraising revolve around

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.760
 the proclamation of the gospel, 1 Corinthians 918, 2 Corinthians 117.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.960
 We may therefore begin by qualifying our considerations, limiting them particularly

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.640
 to gospel ministry.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.400
 In other words, the Dorian principle concerns the explicit proclamation of the word of God,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.200
 rather than other forms of charitable service, which may be too broad to warrant regulation.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.760
 However, we should pause given that Christ's command extends beyond preaching, including

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.520
 miraculous healings among those things which should not be offered for price.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.040
 Matthew 108.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.880
 In context, the purpose of those miraculous healings is to demonstrate the veracity of the good news,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.080
 Matthew 107.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.920
 In here, the gospel is still in view.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.840
 Certain types of service, like miracle working, have such a relationship to that message that

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.360
 while the gospel may be proclaimed apart from them, they cannot rightly exist, divorced

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.240
 from the proclamation of the gospel.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:35.040
 For our purposes, gospel ministry is any activity that proclaims the gospel or directly attends

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.040
 to its proclamation.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.000
 Though not immediately obvious, this includes all religious instruction.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.280
 From a biblical standpoint, the goal of any Christian teaching is not to stand on its own,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.440
 but ultimately to communicate the gospel.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.840
 1 Corinthians 2 2, Hebrews 6 1.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.840
 Consequently, the Dorian principle regulates teaching in many formats and contexts.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.080
 From sermons to books, both live and recorded formats line its purview.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.760
 From Sunday school to seminary, it governs contexts both within and outside the regular

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.280
 operations of the church.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.440
 Accepting support.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.120
 The Dorian principle speaks of support and its acceptance.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.800
 Within the category of acceptance, we may define three modes, requirement, request, and

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.600
 receipt.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.040
 Each forms a concentric circle within the other.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.240
 Those who require support are willing to request and receive it.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.480
 And those who request support are willing to receive it.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.380
 The Dorian principle forbids each one outside the context of co-labor, but identifies each

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.280
 inner circle as more problematic than the proceeding.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.120
 Requirement

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.840
 Just clear among the three, a minister cannot require support in exchange for ministry.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.520
 To hold ministry hostage for a ransom would make one a free agent rather than a servant

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.360
 with the charge from his master.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.180
 Rather than requiring repayment, a godly minister should, like Paul, be willing to spend

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.640
 and be spent 2 Corinthians 1215.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.720
 Beyond requiring payment, the Dorian principle prohibits requesting anything in exchange

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.680
 for ministry.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:36.000
 Such a request implies a direct obligation to give an exchange for the service rendered.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.240
 Voluntary payment is still payment, not co-labor.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.240
 Receipt

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.320
 Finally, ministers ought not to receive an exchange for ministry.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.040
 Many imagine that unsolicited gifts should be free from scrutiny, but even that which

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.520
 is not requested may constitute reciprocity.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.520
 Of course, all these prohibitions hinge on the phrase in exchange for ministry.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.640
 That is, they only forbid reciprocity, not co-labor.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.800
 One may receive co-labor, even request it since a request is not imposed a direct obligation,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.360
 but appeals to divine obligation.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:24.000
 Additionally, one may even require co-labor for ministry, voluntarily abstaining from ministry

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.040
 as determined by financial need.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.040
 For example, in Corinth, Paul refrained from full-time ministry and instead labored to support

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.320
 himself.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.800
 When fellow evangelists from Macedonia arrived, presumably with financial relief, see a

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:46.760
 Philippians 415, Paul resumed full-time ministry, Acts 185.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.320
 Jesus even commanded his disciples only to go where they would have support to do the

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.520
 work of ministry, Matthew 1014.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:01.480
 And these circumstances, money is a means rather than an end.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.640
 Ministerial staff

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.200
 Considering the Dorian principle in the life of the church gives us an opportunity to

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.560
 evaluate how we think about weekly financial contributions.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:18.240
 First, the congregation ought not be misled about the nature of their giving.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:23.000
 Rather than being taught that they owe ministers directly, they should be taught that they owe

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.840
 it to God to support his ministers, especially those from whom they have benefited.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:34.040
 Beyond this, they should understand that their giving is an act of co-labor.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:39.240
 In the words of Dei Carson, the church does not pay its ministers, rather it provides

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.240
 them with resources so that they are able to serve freely.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.480
 The congregation works together with their ministers to ensure the gospel is proclaimed.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:55.720
 As such, it moves the charitable act from a negative center to a positive center, from

00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:00.640
 the cancelling of debt owed to investment in the kingdom of heaven.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:05.800
 Not only does a right understanding of giving correct the airing ethic, it has the power

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.480
 to enliven the giver.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.320
 Of course, ministers also should recognize the nature of their income.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.800
 To quote another prominent theologian, Christian ministers should refuse remuneration for the

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.160
 sake of the gospel.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:29.040
 When Christians accept money for ministry, they ought never view it as a wage but as a gift.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.960
 While the distinction between wage and gift might differ from our chosen vocabulary

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:40.360
 of reciprocity and co-labor, the concerns coincide.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:45.000
 Cermans Naturally, preaching ministry should offer sermons

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.800
 at no charge.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:52.300
 Few churches, if any, have a turnstile at the door, but it was not that long ago that many

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.520
 charged purants.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:00.320
 Moreover, with the rise of technology, sermons have been sold in print in digital form for

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.320
 some time.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:09.320
 As just one prominent example, an archive of Tim Keller's sermons currently costs $1,600

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:15.720
 dollars, marked down from a list priced of $3,300.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.000
 In contrast to these commercial practices, the church should engage in the free proclamation

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.520
 of the gospel, not only by permitting visitors to freely enter the building for worship services,

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.840
 but also by providing any recordings freely.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.400
 These churches already practice this, sharing their sermons freely on sites such as Cerman

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.040
 Audio.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.880
 Honorariums do not violate this ethic, but should be regarded as a fruitful means of supporting

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.320
 interim preachers and teachers.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.560
 If the purpose of a church is to gather for the collective worship of God in the preaching

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:56.920
 and hearing of the Word, the congregation and preacher work toward the same end.

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:02.280
ord by a mutual desire to properly honor God, a church provides an honorarium as an act

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.240
 of co-labor.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.880
 If a regular preacher receives from his church in coordination with his labor is among them,

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.680
 then a visiting preacher may do the same.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:18.880
 Thus, Peter was able to arrive at Corinth and receive financial support for his work there,

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:24.360
 CF, 1 Corinthians 9-5.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.360
 Special Services

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:31.240
 The irregular religious worship services warrant special scrutiny.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.080
 Any amount of religious instruction, including worship leading, should be offered without

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.720
 pay.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.880
 Such charges are not unheard of in modern times.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.920
 For example, the church passed by the then president of the Southern Baptist Convention

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:51.480
 charged for entry to their 2019 Good Friday worship service.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:57.720
 Frequently, special worship events run outside the context of the church, under the auspices

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.560
 of a concert or conference.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:06.960
 Such affairs typically charge not only to recuperate physical costs, but also for religious

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.520
 instruction.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:16.560
 Ticket sales that fail to identify the exact object of purchase, food, music, a message.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.920
 Along with a blurring between worship and entertainment, threatened to transgress the

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.720
 Dwarriam Principle.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:30.240
 Our concerns regarding special services extend to weddings, funerals, and even counseling.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.920
 Unlike typical teaching or worship services, these tend to focus on a particular party,

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.600
 the newly wedded, the family of the deceased, or the council.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.960
 And these circumstances, the needs of the few rise to the forefront, and an exchange of

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:52.280
 money suggests that it is offered in return for the gospel ministry provided in that context.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.960
 Not only should churches in its ministers refrain from advertising a fee, they should also

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.080
 not accept one.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:05.480
 As already stated, honorariums do not necessarily violate our stated principle, but where money

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:11.000
 changes hands between one need of a service and one who provides it, is it clear that gospel

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.760
 ministry is not being purchased?

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:20.920
 Conceivably, one could give as an act of co-labor at a special service, but the context suggests

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.960
 that any such money would constitute a direct payment.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.800
 Nothing apparent distinguishes a check-profer to a counseling pastor and a check-profer to

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.280
 a secular therapist.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:37.800
 The ambiguity of the situation typically places the minister in a position where he cannot

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:43.280
 discern the intent of the individual and accept money responsibly.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:49.400
 Such a minister ought to, like Paul, simply refuse funds and situations that suggest direct

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:56.680
 repayment and look forward to accepting support in less compromising circumstances.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:02.800
 The importance of context As we've seen, context indicates

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.280
 a financial exchange as reciprocity or co-labor.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:13.240
 For example, and the context of a church plant, Paul rejects current the infunds as reciprocity.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:19.760
 1 Corinthians 9-15, and the context of being sent out to other regions, he gladly receives

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.760
 them.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.760
 1 Corinthians 16-6

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.760
 Several aspects of context may indicate the nature of a contribution, but chief among

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.920
 these are language and/or earmarking.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:37.920
 For example, using the language of co-labor, a ministry might advertise, "You've seen

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.240
 our impact.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.600
 Please consider partnering with us."

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.720
 By employing the terminology of partnership, this call to action indicates that any who

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:53.120
 give join in laboring for the Lord, bringing their resources into a common pool for a common

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.520
 purpose.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:15:00.760
 However, a ministry might solicit donations with a following appeal.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:05.640
 You've been afraid from our teaching, please consider giving back.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:11.120
 This language of reciprocity suggests a direct obligation to man rather than an indirect

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.640
 obligation mediated by God.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:20.320
 Similarly, suggested donations offer a clever attempt at relieving one of the notion of obligation,

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:27.120
 but almost certainly earmark a contribution as repayment.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.560
 Opposition and boycotts

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:35.560
 The Dorian Principle stands at odds with much gospel proclamation as it exists in the world,

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.760
 while inconsistency on this point may indicate false teaching.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:45.960
 True teachers also adopt compromised practices unaware of the implications.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.520
 Should we oppose a boycott such ministries to promote a biblical ethic?

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:56.120
 Thankfully, the Apostle Paul gives a rather direct answer.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:01.120
 Observing that some preach Christ, not sincerely, he responds.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.440
 What then?

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:08.120
 Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed and in that

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.360
 ivory choice, Philippians 1-18.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:18.160
 Along with Paul, we should rejoice at the gospel efforts of those who preach truly, but not

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.920
 as sincerely as they ought.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:27.120
 And tanganistic pursuits such as boycotts are not only unnecessary, but largely unhelpful,

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.840
 and it would be unwise to intentionally cut oneself off from the vast array of biblical

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.480
 teaching offered at a cost.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:42.160
 Similar to boycotts, one may circumvent paywalls that restrict access to ministry, e.g., via

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.320
 illicit downloads.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:49.640
 If the gospel is the Lord's to offer, and ministers are not permitted to sell their teaching,

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.320
 such behavior may seem justified.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:57.680
 And considering the temple tax, Jesus offers a nuanced response to unjust financial

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.320
 impositions attached to spiritual blessings.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.000
 What do you think, Simon?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.600
 From whom do the kings of the earth take toll or tax?

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.040
 From their sons or from others?

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.800
 And when he said from others, Jesus said to him, "Then the sons are free.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:19.680
 However, not to give offense to them, go to the sea and cast a hook and take the first

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:24.680
 fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth, you will find a shekel.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.160
 Take that and give it to them for me and for yourself."

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:33.760
 Matthew 17, 25b, 27.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.520
 Having a right to the benefits of the temple, the disciples do not owe the tax to those who

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.800
 collect it.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:46.800
 However, for the sake of peace, it is often best to bear such burdens.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.000
 Conclusion

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.040
 The Dorian Principle offers a foundation from which we can begin to concretize the New Testament

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.880
 model of ministry fundraising.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:02.540
 In the next chapters, we will explore more specifics, beginning with the relationship

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.520
 between the Dorian Principle and Paratured Church ministry.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.520
