00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240
 The Dorian Principle, a biblical response to the commercialization of Christianity by

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.600
 Con Leoans.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.400
 Chapter 7 The Greed of Wolves Feature vs Essence

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.080
 About a year ago, I moved into a new home with a small tree in the backyard.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.840
 I was thinking about removing the tree until winter came around and one of my kids found

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.800
 something interesting on it.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.640
 He was an orange and a tasty one at that.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.280
 I decided not to uproot the tree, but keep it.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.600
 As Jesus said, "A good tree bears good fruit."

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.080
 However, unlike me and my orange tree, Christ's concern did not revolve around identifying

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.120
 literal dead plants.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.320
 Specifically, he wanted to equip his disciples to recognize and reject false teachers.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.100
 Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.300
 wolves.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.120
 You will recognize them by their fruits.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.200
 Are grapes gathered from thorn bushes or figs from thistles?

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.760
 So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.720
 A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.560
 Three tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.000
 Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.720
 Matthew 7, 15-20.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.960
 A bad orange tree might produce bad oranges, or even no oranges at all.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.880
 But what does a false teacher produce?

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.320
 Of course, false teaching is the characteristic staple of a false teacher, but Jesus reveals

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.320
 something more in this passage.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.840
 He describes these male factors as ravenous wolves, implying an underlying motivation of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.880
 creed.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.920
 One may play down creed as merely a peripheral feature of false teachers, but the recurring

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.920
 drumbeat of the New Testament places it at the heart of all false teaching.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.760
 We could imagine a false teacher who lives a life of poverty, but the issue does not revolve

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.880
 around money so much as it does the pursuit of personal benefit.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:27.480
 Indeed, if one does not serve Christ, he has in mind his own gain, C.F. Matthew 624.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.680
 In other words, the falseness of a false teacher does not merely hinge on erroneous doctrine,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.320
 but on the teacher himself.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.560
 Dintures are regarded false teeth, though they may bite and chew like real teeth.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.200
 Likewise, one who seeks his own gain in ministry is a false teacher, though he may promote

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.680
 a similar, authentic doctrine.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.200
 As we saw in the previous chapter, Paul's rejection of ministerial reciprocity extends

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.200
 from his sincerity, i.e. his lack of ulterior motive.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.720
 Conversely, all who minister with an eye toward material payment possess an ulterior

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.240
 motive, unveiling themselves as less than sincere as false teachers.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.160
 This observation elevates the Dorian principle beyond a nice to have idea.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.960
 If the New Testament anticipates that we should be able to distinguish false teachers from

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.680
 true teachers by their disposition towards reciprocity, then the Dorian principle is an essential

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.520
 component of God-honoring ministry.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.360
 In this chapter, I would like to walk through several examples of false teachers in the New

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.360
 Testament.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.960
 In each one, we will see greed tied tightly to their identity.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.880
 Further establishing the true ministry needs to be marked with the sincerity of the Dorian

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.400
 principle.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.040
 The scribes and Pharisees.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.760
 Notably, the scribes and Pharisees fall directly into this category of false teachers.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.520
 While some of their expansive rules and allowances are at odds with the proper understanding of

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.080
 God's law,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.640
 the New Testament regards the Pharisees as the contemporary sect of Judaism with the highest

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.520
 doctrinal fidelity.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:24.320
 In other words, they taught with more accuracy than any other group of their day.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.920
 CF acts 236, 265, Philippians 35.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:38.120
 Nevertheless, Jesus condemns them as false teachers, largely on account of their greed.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.520
 The wear of the scribes who like to walk round in long robes and love greetings in the market

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:50.040
 places, and the best seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at feast, who devour

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.680
 widows' houses and for pretense make long prayers.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.640
 They will receive the greater condemnation.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.280
 Luke 20, 46 through 47.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.640
 CF, Matthew 23, 15, 25.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.520
 Each of these criticisms focuses on covetousness rather than doctrinal error.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.840
 The scribes desire honor in the form of recognition and material gain.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:24.520
 Jesus presents this greed not merely as an arbitrary vice that attends the action of the scribes,

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.320
 but as something central that drives their evil deeds.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.080
 Notice also the pattern by which Jesus exposes the heart of covetousness in this passage.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.040
 It is not the long robes or greetings that are wrong, but the love of prestige that is.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.640
 Long prayers are not problematic, but pretense is a porant.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:51.520
 However, Jesus interrupts this pattern when he speaks of widows' houses.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.920
 Here the matter goes beyond the intentions of the heart.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.680
 Christ describes the action itself in such a way that it could not accord with pure motives.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.080
 The devour another's property is to maliciously harm them.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.200
 At this point, when material wealth is in view, the heart issue present in each of the other

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.920
 circumstances becomes most directly manifest.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.240
 This identity between insincereity and the pursuit of wealth echoes in John 10, where Jesus

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.960
 eludes to the Pharisees of the previous chapter, describing them as "hired hands."

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.000
 He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.240
 and leaves the sheep in fleas, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.920
 He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.320
 John 10, 12-13.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.320
 Jesus offers no accusation of excess, as though minister should strive for some ethic of moderation

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:59.240
 that the hired hand has violated by demanding more than a reasonable compensation.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:06.440
 The ulterior motive of gain in any quantity sufficiently incriminates the hired hand, differentiating

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.280
 him from the shepherd.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.840
 Even here, in the pages of the Gospels, the New Testament prepares us to identify greed,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:21.120
 the pursuit of ministry for the sake of earthly recompense, as the identifying marker of false

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.400
 teachers.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.600
 Simon the Magician.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.920
 The narrative of Simon the Magician in Acts stands out among encounters between money and

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.400
 ministry.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.640
 Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the Apostles' hands,

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.560
 he offered the money, saying, "Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.000
 hands may receive the Holy Spirit."

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.440
 But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.280
 the gift of God with money.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.680
 You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God."

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.040
 Acts 8, 18-21.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:13.080
 Do not mistake the ethical transgression for a misunderstanding about the mechanics of impartation.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:18.120
 Explicitly, Peter rebuked Simon because he thought the gift of God could be obtained by

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.120
 money.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.960
 Implicitly, the Apostle rebuked the Magician because he thought the gift of God ought

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.440
 to be given for money.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:32.040
 Simon treats Peter as a minister for profit, and potentially sets himself up to be one as

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:38.040
 well, doling out this power to others who have the coined spare.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.720
 By virtue of its narrative form, this passage centers around the particulars of one

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.800
 individual, Simon.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:50.440
 However, the prominence of this event in the fledgling church signifies the divine delivery

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.080
 of a generalized principle.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.680
 Not only is it impossible to facilitate the distribution of the gift of the Holy Spirit

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:04.840
 by means of financial exchange, it is dishonorable to make any such attempt.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:11.840
 Broadly speaking, any ministry, miraculous or non-miraculous, constitutes an attempt to

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.040
 impart the blessing of the Holy Spirit.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:22.120
 In this light, the passage condemns all ministerial reciprocity, and the words of Dei Carson, those

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.640
 who charge for spiritual ministry are dabbling in Simon.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.640
 The Balanites

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:35.000
 Both Peter and Jude compare false teachers at large to Balan, the profit willing to prophesy

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.360
 ill for a price.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:43.160
 After two explicit mentions of greed, 2 Peter 2 3 14

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.360
 Peter speaks broadly of the false teachers who will arise.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.520
 For saking the right way, they have gone astray, they have followed the way of Balan, the

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.680
 son at Bayor, who loved gain from wrongdoing.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.680
 2 Peter 2 15

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.120
 Jude offers a similar description of false teachers.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.560
 Go to them for they have walked in the way of gain and abandoned themselves for the sake

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.680
 of gain to Balan's error and perished in Korah's rebellion.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.920
 2 Jude 11

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:21.320
 By evoking the name of Balan, Peter and Jude describe false teachers as primarily motivated

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.920
 by greed.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:30.080
 Additionally, both Peter and Jude employ the descriptor sensuality to characterize false

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.880
 teachers desire for worldly pleasures.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.880
 2 Peter 2 2

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.080
 Jude 4

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:42.560
 While this likely refers to the licences teaching of the false teachers, the connection to material

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.400
 greed should not be missed.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.960
 Peter offers greed as an immediate expansion on the term sensuality.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.600
 2 Peter 2 2 3

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:59.400
 Jude associates Balanistic greed with animalistic impulses Jude 10 through 11.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.520
 Most sensuality primarily connotes sexual implications.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.960
 It more broadly refers to all the desires of the flesh.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.760
 Note that even the tenth commandment thou shalt not covet.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.720
 Unites the notions of greed and lust.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.840
 2 Peter's introduction of Balan hints to this link, spelling his father's name in Greek

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.920
 as Bosoire rather than Bayor.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:29.960
 That is, Peter identifies Balan as a son of the flesh, transliterating the Hebrew word

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:35.040
 for flesh rather than the actual name of Balan's father.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.120
 Jude further exposes this connection between greed and fleshly desire in his mention of

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:47.240
 shepherds feeding themselves, Jude 12, an allusion to Ezekiel 34, 1 through 10, and the

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.760
 shepherds of Israel who prayed on the sheep.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:57.160
 Similarly, Paul speaks of false teachers as being motivated by their appetites, Romans 16

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:04.280
 18, and having their bellies as their gods, Philippine 319, most likely referring to their

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.480
 desire for compensation.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.920
 2 Peter and Jude play greed at the heart of false teaching.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:17.720
 The motivation of wealth stands at odds with the path of a true teacher.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.920
 The money lovers.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.960
 Whether they represent a single party or not, Paul depicts the false teachers of the pastoral

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.000
 epistles as lovers of money.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.800
 Though their origin and many of their beliefs are uncertain, what is clear from Paul's words

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.280
 in the pastoral epistles is the motivation of false teachers.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.320
 It is greed.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.920
 And 1 Timothy 6, 3 through 10, the apostle warns against false teachers, listing their

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.920
 various qualities.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:54.600
 Finally, he settles on the assertion that false teachers consider godliness to be a means

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.000
 of gain.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.600
 1 Timothy 6, 5.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:03.160
 If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:08.560
 Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching that accords with godliness, he is puffed up with conceit

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.320
 and understands nothing.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:16.400
 He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words which produce envy,

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:22.240
 dissonction, slander, evil suspicions, and constant friction among people who are depraved in

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:27.920
 mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.320
 1 Timothy 6, 3 through 5.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:38.280
 Notably, Paul phrases his rebuke to address all false teachers, speaking of any who teach

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.280
 a different doctrine.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:44.840
 He may have in mind particular false teachers, but that does not limit the scope of his

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:49.960
 application, which is put forward as a general principle.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:56.260
 The apostles' profile of a false teacher includes the invariable element of greed, that

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:01.960
 fundamental component which compromises sincere ministry.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:08.840
 Paul addresses lovers of money in 2 Timothy 3 too, again describing them as having a superficial

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.920
 godliness, 2 Timothy 3.5.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.280
 Additionally, he compares them to Janice and Jambers.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:22.400
 Just as Janice and Jambers opposed Moses, so these men also opposed the truth.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.640
 Men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.240
 2 Timothy 3.8.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:34.160
 These two are not mentioned in the Old Testament, but Jewish tradition records them as magicians

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:39.080
 in the employ of Pharaoh, apprentices of the Prophet Balaam.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:46.160
 Not only does service to Pharaoh indicate the pursuit of riches, CF Hebrews 1125.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:52.200
 But as we have already seen, the apostles used Balaam's name synonymously with greed-driven

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.920
 prophecy.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:58.920
 This issue of false teachers and the love of money is undoubtedly the same warning that

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.520
 was issued in the previous Epistle to Timothy.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:08.760
 Once again, Paul highlights the love of money as the standard trait of false teachers.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:15.920
 Likewise, and his epistels to Titus, Paul contrasts true teaching with false teaching.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:21.120
 In particular, he warns against the circumcision party.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:26.640
 They must be silenced, since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for shameful gain

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.840
 what they ought not to teach, Titus 111.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.600
 The doctrines of the circumcision party are not altogether certain, but the New Testament

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:40.160
 presents this faction as a prototypical band of false teachers.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.600
 CF Galatians 212, Acts 112.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.600
 This is significant.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.560
 By limiting itself on the details of their beliefs, but painting a robust picture of their

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:59.040
 motivations, Scripture offers generalized teaching in a particular or wise context.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.400
 The core accusations applied to this sect are intended to apply broadly to false teachers

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.480
 of any sect.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:11.360
 This passage does not merely offer greed as a potential trait of false teachers, but as

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.000
 something that universally characterizes them.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:22.400
 All false teachers are motivated by greed, and all teachers motivated by greed are false.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.920
 Requirements for elders In the New Testament, established requirements

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:32.640
 for elders function as guards against false teachers assuming the office.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:39.920
 It is significant, therefore, that these listings of qualifications invariably prohibit greed.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:45.760
 Each passage regards greed not merely as an unbecoming attribute of a true teacher, but

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.880
 as a mark of a false teacher.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:54.120
 This connection appears most strikingly in Titus, where the description of the true teacher,

00:16:54.120 --> 00:17:01.160
 Titus 1, 5 through 9, is placed in immediate contrast with the description of a false teacher.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:06.920
 Titus 1, 10 through 16 In particular, an elder is not to be greedy

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:12.720
 for shameful gain, Titus 1, 7, because there are many false teachers who teach for the sake

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.040
 of shameful gain, Titus 1, 11.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:23.080
 First Timothy 3, 3, plainly forbids an elder not to be a lover of money.

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:28.280
 Later in the same epistle, Paul describes the lover of money as the hallmark of false

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:34.480
 ministry, a root of all kinds of evil, 1 Timothy 6, 10.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.240
 First Peter does not directly address false teaching, but its prohibition against greed

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:43.160
 stands in line with the previous passages.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:49.680
 First Peter 5, 2, requires that elders minister eagerly not for shameful gain.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:56.360
 While the contrast is not immediately apparent, these two are offered within a list of opposites,

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.840
 an elder is not to minister under compulsion, but willingly.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:07.920
 He is not to be domineering, but in an example, in this light, Eagerness stands opposed to shameful

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.600
 gain.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.120
 Those who desire money for ministry have a competing motive.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:19.720
 We might be quick to reduce this competing motive as problematic only when it is central

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:25.440
 to the minister, but the text does not warrant such qualifications.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:33.520
 Any competing motivation compromises the sincerity, i.e. the eagerness of a minister.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.880
 In the words of one theologian, at the very least, this passage implies that Christian

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:44.000
 leaders should not be motivated to minister by the thought of remuneration or any particular

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.400
 level of payment.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.720
 Conclusion

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:53.880
 Each of these passages we examine regards greed as the tell tale characteristic of a false

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.880
 teacher.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.720
 Wolves are not wolves apart from their ravenous appetite.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:04.840
 So to answer our original question, what is the fruit of false teachers?

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.320
 They are greed.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:12.040
 In more concrete demonstrations, it is the acceptance of reciprocity, their exchange of

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.200
 ministry for money.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.880
 The New Testament does not merely offer the Dorian principle as a way to honor God in

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:25.880
 ministry, but additionally as a way of discerning true teachers from false teachers, in a world

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.200
 that has lost this standard, it can hardly function as such.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:38.000
 However, if restored, this ethic could operate as intended as a marker of legitimate servants

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 of the Lord.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.160
 True ministers would be known for freely offering the gospel.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:50.600
 False teachers, motivated by greed, would be recognized by their receipt of reciprocity.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:55.640
 Lack of adherence to the Dorian principle would raise a red flag, marking out wolves

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.760
 among sheep.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:02.720
 And the next chapter will take a look at a particularly notable set of false teachers,

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.040
 the super apostles of Corinth.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.040
 End of chapter 7
