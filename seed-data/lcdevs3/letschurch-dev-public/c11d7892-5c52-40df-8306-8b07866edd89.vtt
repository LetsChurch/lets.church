00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 The Dorian Principle, a biblical response to the commercialization of Christianity by

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:16.720
 Conley Owens, Chapter 13, the issue of copyright, protection versus freedom.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.040
 In the mid-sixth century, an Irish monk named Vinion traveled home from Rome, excitement

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.640
 gripped him for he had come in possession of a great treasure, a Bible.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.320
 While he certainly had access to some scripture in his hometown, this Bible represented

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.040
 a pure and more complete copy than anything he owned, and all in a single volume.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.960
 Nearby monks heard of Vinion's new prize, and many came from significant distances to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.960
 see it.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.640
 It more than pleased Vinion to show it off, yet all the same, he was rather possessive of

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.400
 his book.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.600
 Among those who visited was a monk named Colomkill.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.240
 A charismatic young redhead.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.400
 He was equally excited by the Bible, so much in fact, that he sneaked into the church

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.680
 where it was kept in order to spend the night copying it.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.120
 He administered a scriptorium nearby, and anticipated the opportunity to reproduce and disseminate

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.320
 the scriptures on a grander scale.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.160
 When Vinion discovered the act taking place, he became furious.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.400
 Soon afterward, he pursued litigation.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.920
 Both men requested an audience before the high-kinged herment for arbitration.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.400
 Each one confident that justice would rule in his favor.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.480
 Vinion argued that because the book was his, the copy was his as well.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.880
 Colomkill responded, offering his defense.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.160
 My friends claim seeks to apply a worn out law to a new reality.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.240
 Books are different to other chattels, possessions, and the law should recognize this.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.600
 Old men like us, who have received the new heritage of knowledge through books, have an obligation

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.320
 to spread that knowledge by copying and distributing those books far and wide.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.400
 I haven't used up Vinion's book by copying it.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.920
 He still has the original, and that original is none the worse for my having copied it.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.920
 Nor has it decreased in value because I made a transcript of it.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.160
 The knowledge in books should be available to anyone who wants to read them, and has the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.920
 skills or is worthy to do so.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.440
 It is wrong to hide such knowledge away, or to attempt to extinguish the divine things that

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.520
 the books contain.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.680
 To Colomkill's shock, the king ruled in Vinion's favor.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.720
 Many speculations surround this event.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.960
 Perhaps it represented an unbiased attempt at justice, or perhaps the court-counselor, a druid,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.960
 sought to hinder the advancement of Christianity.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.800
 Regardless, the details of the story certainly make for interesting considerations.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.160
 In our day, access to efficient copying is vastly more widespread than it was in Colomkills.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.840
 Through the digitization of information, even a child can reproduce a book in near-infantestimal

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.720
 time, at near-infinite quantities.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.200
 Through the internet, that same work may be disseminated to nearly every person on the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.960
 planet.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.520
 If the fire a monk worried that outdated laws would hinder the advancement of the gospel

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.480
 in a new era.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.520
 How much more should we revisit those same concerns?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.280
 Defined broadly, copyright is an illegal mechanism that regulates the reproduction and use

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.200
 of creative works.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.720
 While copyright offers legal protections to authors, it simultaneously restricts the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.480
 freedoms of those who consume creative works.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.080
 In this chapter, I would like to comment on how the Dorian Principle should shape our

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.440
 view of its use in ministry, and then provide some alternatives for modern ministry workers.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.760
 Copyright and Obligation.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.200
 The conclusions in the previous chapters of this book should lead us to question the

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.680
 Church's use of copyright protection mechanisms in the context of gospel ministry.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.920
 If the minister is to give freely, as he really does so if he retains exclusive rights to

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.480
 the content of his proclamation.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.240
 In my estimation, the answer is a resounding no.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.440
 Even though maintaining full copyright protection does not necessitate in an exchange of money,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.440
 it does impose a burden on the recipient of ministry.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.680
 Apart from express permission, he may not copy, modify, or redistribute that work, the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.920
 information he has received.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.480
 Note that this imposes a requirement, requirement being the innermost circle of the forms of acceptance

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.240
 that violate the Dorian Principle.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.520
 As such, it is the most serious form of violation.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.880
 Moreover, typically money is involved in the exchange.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.920
 Ministers refuse ministry in the form of books, recorded lectures, etc.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.560
 Apart from a payment collected from the recipient.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.280
 Additionally, the involuntary nature of copyright precludes co-labor.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.520
 One who complies with legal restrictions does not offer a free will sacrifice to the Lord,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.240
 but only a concession to the one protected by the law.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.960
 One who gives money to receive access to gospel-related material does so only as an exchange, compensating

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.600
 another to settle in debt owed to him.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.200
 Copyright and sincerity

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.820
 Stepping back and examining things through the lens of sincerity, we must question the

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.840
 earnestness of one who asserts all copyrights over the content of their ministry.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.240
 If they impose restrictions or require payment, can they truly say that they operate as a servant

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.240
 of Christ?

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.440
 CF 1 Corinthians 9/16

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.080
 If they impose restrictions or require payment, can they truly say that they are a servant

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.720
 to all so that more might be one?

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.280
 CF 1 Corinthians 9/19

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.920
 To be clear, I think highly of fellow pastors who have writing ministries, many of whom

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.560
 engage in the kind of exchanges forbidden by the Dorian Principle.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.040
 Christians have never directly faced these issues and therefore have made their decisions

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.880
 in ignorance.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.320
 In a sense, I hold nothing against them because I likely would have taken the same steps

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.200
 had I never been led to especially ruminate on the passages we've examined.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.480
 However, all this being said, I cannot ignore the logical conclusion of what the Bible says

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.720
 about sincere ministry.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.560
 From a human perspective, the error is understandable.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.120
 From a divine perspective, these models of ministry culpably transgress Christ's plan for

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.280
 the advancement of the gospel.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.320
 While the day-to-day activities of the local church largely remain within the boundary

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.480
 set by the Dorian Principle, the advent of the Christian publishing industry has introduced

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.120
 breaches of sweeping proportions.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.000
 Believers who want to deepen their knowledge of the faith frequently find themselves required

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.560
 to give to an author or publisher.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.840
 I.e. the copyright holder, before receiving the benefit of some ministry.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.440
 The issue goes much further than books, encompassing Bible study software, performance rights

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.840
 for worship songs, etc.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.240
 Of course, it has not always been this way.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.720
 While the Dorian Principle has always been in danger of being violated, for the majority

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.520
 of the life of the church, there were relatively few opportunities for temptation or confusion

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.040
 to arise.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:44.000
 However, the advancement of publication technology, especially as it has culminated in digital

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.200
 media, has presented the church with a test of faithfulness.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.800
 Unprepared for the challenge set before her, the church has blindly followed the model

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.680
 of the world and its publication practices, distributing materials for a fee.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:06.120
 Additionally, as the cost of reproduction and distribution wanes, being virtually negligible

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:13.040
 for digital content in the present era, the severity of transgression wax is stronger.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.600
 Prior to the 20th century, to purchase a book was to purchase a bound edition of printed

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.600
 pages.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.360
 One was not paying for the content so much as they were paying for the tangible product

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.720
 as a whole, a matter of limited ethical concern.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:33.640
 Today, a physical book in its content are more easily distinguished as paper and data.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.440
 While people still purchase paper books, the sale of e-books indicates the publisher's

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:44.480
 intent to charge not only for the physical good, but for the content.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:50.400
 A completed work may be disseminated online to millions at no cost to the producer, yet

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:56.080
 ministering entities often default to charging for the service.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.960
 Not only does the use of copyright protection have potential to violate the Dorian Principle,

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.080
 in most instances, it constitutes the most direct violation conceivable.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.760
 Regardless of the intent of those behind such ministries, to require payment in exchange

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:15.640
 for religious education is to engage in the practices condemned by both scripture and

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.880
 the early church.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.160
 Alternative licensing.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.280
 Simply stated, the antithesis of using the power of governing authorities to enforce copyright

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.080
 is not using the power of governing authorities to enforce copyright.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:36.200
 However, under United States law, a creative work is protected by copyright as soon as it

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.840
 is fixed in a tangible medium.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.200
 A minister who has no intention of taking advantage of these protections must go out of

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.600
 his way to explicitly waive his rights if he wishes to assure others they are free to

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:52.920
 use the creative products of his ministry, however they wish.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:58.000
 To that end, institutions have fashioned a variety of licenses.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 The earliest of these licenses were largely designed to accommodate collaborative software

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.800
 projects.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:11.200
 But most recently, initiatives have addressed the needs of non-software, i.e. non-functional

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.480
 projects.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:20.400
 The most popular of these creative commons is not a single license, but a suite of licenses

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.280
 designed to give copyright holders the ability to mix and match specific rights they would

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.240
 like to reserve or waive.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:34.080
 Each creative commons license ensures that a work may be distributed in its original form,

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.120
 but additional restrictions may apply.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.960
 As an exercise, I'd like us to look at these restrictions and evaluate their implications

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.120
 for Dorian ministry.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.120
 Adaptation.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:53.000
 The first option available for a creative commons license is the No-Drivative Works feature.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.600
 One who applies this to their creative work restricts others from making adaptations of

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.080
 that work.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.800
 For a book, this would prohibit translations and audio adaptations.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:09.480
 For a song, this would prohibit musical rearrangements and public performances.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.240
 Anyone wishing to make such adaptations would be required to obtain express permission from

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.560
 the copyright holder.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.920
 Such restrictions do not accord with the Dorian principle.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:24.800
 The recipient of ministry should not be bound to comply with the wishes of the minister.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.640
 It is not sufficient to talk merely in terms of financial burden, all forms of burden,

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:35.200
 i.e., direct horizontal obligation to the minister, fall in the same category.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:40.320
 These stipulations do far more to hinder the gospel than advance it.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.560
 One may object that allowing adaptations opens a work to distortion in perversion.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.880
 True, but at a fundamental level, all good things may be corrupted.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:56.360
 Further, the history of Christian resources testifies that works available for adaptation

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.800
 and encouraged more good than they do harm.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:05.480
 For example, Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, produced a modified version of the King

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.000
 James Bible in order to promote his apparent beliefs.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.960
 Yet few would argue that the harm caused by this document outweighs the proliferation

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:18.720
 of the Bible in audiobooks, tracks, study Bibles, and dramatic readings, all made possible

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.800
 through the availability of the King James version.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.840
 Most importantly, such pragmatic objections cannot dominate the principled concern of

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.960
 Dorian ministry.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.960
 Commercial use.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.000
 Creative Commons additionally provides a non-commercial feature, which prohibits use of

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.360
 the creative work for commercial purposes.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:46.560
 For example, this would keep one from directly selling the licensed material, or incorporating

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.600
 it into a derivative work that is then sold.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.800
 From a secular perspective, this feature has received substantial pushback due to the

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.800
 inherent ambiguity in the concept of commercial purposes.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.360
 The text of the license is using this feature speaks specifically of uses that are primarily

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:11.360
 intended for or directed toward commercial advantage, or private monetary compensation.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.640
 Even if it is not sold in the traditional fashion, an entity that uses a work licensed

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.360
 for non-commercial use in a way that supports a commercial endeavor potentially violates

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.760
 the terms of the license.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:28.960
 Regardless, the guidelines we have already set give us a clear path forward.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.520
 Restricting uses of a product of ministry, even commercial uses, does not accord with

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.320
 the Dorian principle.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.320
 Attribution.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.920
 The most commonly used option of a creative Commons license is the attribution feature.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.040
 This requires that anyone distributing the original license to work or a derivative credit

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.760
 the copyright holder.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:54.600
 For example, a Bible translation license with this feature would require that any tract

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:59.200
 quoting it credit the copyright holder of the translation.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.520
 In several ways, this seems more reasonable than the previous restrictions we have covered.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:09.320
 Unlike those, the requirement of attribution does not imply a friction between the consumer

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.560
 and the copyright holder for typical adaptive uses.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.840
 For the other restrictions, typical uses require explicit authorization from the copyright

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.080
 holder in order to proceed.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.640
 Attribution on the other hand may be provided by anyone downstream apart from any interaction

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.640
 with the copyright holder.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:36.160
 However, from the perspective of Dorian ministry, there is no reason to classify this condition

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.760
 as fundamentally different.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.360
 Even if no money changes hands, it imposes a direct obligation on the recipient of

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.480
 ministry to the minister.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.720
 It should therefore be rejected in the context of gospel ministry.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:55.560
 Naturally, the primary concern is of raving the right to attribution center around plagiarism

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.920
 and misattribution.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.560
 Unfortunately, the complexity of the current situation makes it difficult to provide a simple

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.080
 response.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.600
 Copyright law is designed to address matters related to the eighth command that shall not

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.600
 steal.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:23.320
 Measure to inhibit plagiarism should certainly be welcome, but it is not clear that copyright

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.960
 enforcement was ever the right solution.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.840
 Defamation laws may offer some alternative protection, and perhaps the technology of the

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.480
 future will provide more immediate detection of such misappropriation.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:40.700
 Regardless, in the course of ministry, a Christian's first priority should be the honor of Christ

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:45.520
 rather than security of credit.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.240
 License propagation

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:52.120
 A frequent feature of alternative licenses requires all derivative works provided they

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:57.400
 are disseminated to be made available under the terms of the same license.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:02.700
 This is known as copy left, and guarantees that a creative work is not used and repackaged

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.320
 under more restrictive terms.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:10.400
 This and creative commons provides a share-like feature.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.520
 This particular feature does not require explicit permission from the copyright holder

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.240
 for typical adaptive uses.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:23.700
 Furthermore, it seems to have the added benefit of encouraging others who might use ministry

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.520
 materials in a similar context to embrace the same licensing scheme.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:33.640
 Yet, once again, we must acknowledge that the share-like feature is a restriction that

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.680
 goes beyond what is permitted by the Dorian principle.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:43.320
 First, it implicitly requires the attribution restriction since a license has limited significance

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.320
 apart from an express mention of the one issuing it.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:52.520
 Second, it requires compliance from any producer of an adaptation.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.560
 The public domain

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.240
 Beyond various licenses, another option exists.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.400
 A public domain work is a work that is not subject to copyright protection.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:08.080
 Lacing a work in the public domain is not always straightforward, especially in jurisdictions

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:12.120
 that acknowledge and do not allow for the waiver of moral rights, which include among

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.160
 other things the right to attribution.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:19.400
 In order to provide a simple approach to this, Creative Commons offers the Creative

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.520
 Commons zero public domain dedication.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.000
 Rather than a license, it is a waiver of rights that provides a license fallback and the

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.080
 event the waiver is deemed insufficient.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:36.480
 This dedication states the intent of the author to provide maximal freedom to any consumer

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.000
 of the work.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.320
 In my estimation, a public domain dedication, such as Creative Commons zero, offers the

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.320
 most consistent approach for Dorian ministry.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.360
 While the Dorian principle does not mandate that a minister is explicitly apply such a

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:56.560
 dedication to his work, it does require the spirit of such a dedication be present in

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.720
 all acts of gospel ministry.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:05.640
 To restrict others in their use of any product of gospel ministry is to require direct

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:11.240
 repayment, i.e., reciprocity, and violate the Dorian principle.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:16.440
 In not so many words, it says, "If I provide this ministry to you, you must do something

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.440
 for me."

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:22.400
 Furthermore, employing the power of governing authorities to course others to comply with

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:28.120
 such restrictions adds an objectionable level of hostility to the transgression.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.760
 In response, ministers and ministries should consider waiving any government established

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.880
 copyright protections.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:40.320
 For most creative works and in most jurisdictions, this may be done effectively through the use

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.040
 of Creative Commons zero.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.960
 In the next chapter, I'd like us to consider some practical examples of how modern ministries

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:54.360
 use copyright and ways to bring these practices in line with the Dorian principle.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.440
