00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040
 The Dorian Principle, a biblical response to the commercialization of Christianity by

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.340
 Conley Owens, appendix A, further study.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.600
 I wrote this little book to be an accessible version of a thesis I wrote for a master of

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.800
 Divinity Degree.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.040
 If this book is fascinated you and you would like to dive deeper, I would recommend

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.080
 beginning with that thesis in consulting the bibliography.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.680
 Every topic featured in this book appears in the thesis with extended detail and argument.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.520
 Additionally, it covers some topics I have chosen not to address here.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.880
 For example, a thesis contains the following explorations.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.880
 A deeper analysis of first Corinthians and Paul's concern over matters of conscience.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.000
 A dedicated treatment of each of the four apparent discrepancies in Paul's financial

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.320
 policy.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.440
 A presentation of the Jerusalem collection as an exemplary act of co-labor.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.200
 A biblical theology of co-labor.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.920
 An analysis of objections to pastoral salaries during the time of the Reformation and

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.000
 the modern era.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.040
 An extended examination of the copyright issues surrounding biblical manuscripts, critical

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.280
 editions, and translations.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.120
 The thesis may be found at the Dorian Principle.org.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.120
 of appendix A.
