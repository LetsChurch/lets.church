 The Doreen Principle A Biblical Response to the Commercialization

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:13.320
 of Christianity by Connoly Owens Chapter 5 The Paragative of Servinhood

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.300
 Freedom vs. Duty

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.320
 During my senior year in high school, my parents went away on a week-long trip.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.440
 They hired a babysitter, we'll call her Anne, from my eight-year-old sister.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.840
 The truth be told, my sophomore brother and I probably needed one as well.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.640
 Anne came highly recommended, so my parents paid her generously and left her well-supplied

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.840
 with additional cash in case of emergencies.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.200
 However, Anne was far from responsible.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.880
 She took all the extra money and purchased junk food, primarily jelly beans.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.200
 Yes, jelly beans.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.120
 You can imagine how many jelly beans a decent supply of emergency cash would buy.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.880
 Upon her initial transgression, she gave my brother and me permission to go out at intervals

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.160
 and hours beyond the guidelines my parents had set.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.520
 While I was not always the best behaved teenager, my nefarious use of this freedom only extended

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.520
 to joining some study groups I wouldn't otherwise have joined.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.440
 If you want to know how my brother took advantage of the opportunity, you'll have to ask him.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.760
 When my parents returned, they were less than thrilled and did not receive additional employment

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.080
 in the Ovens household.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.760
 Did Anne have a right to do it as she did?

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.200
 In a sense, yes.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.360
 When my parents hired her, they essentially gave her permission to perform all the tasks

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.160
 of a caretaker in their absence.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.040
 This includes spending money allotted for food or deciding how to keep the kids in line.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.960
 That being said, my parents expected Anne to use this authority in line with their priorities

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.800
 rather than with her own.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.720
 In his epistles, Paul frequently speaks of his right to financial support.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.240
 However, he speaks of this right in the context of his servanthood.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.280
 Just as parents grant a babysitter jurisdiction over a home to uphold their priorities, a servant

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.040
 wields a delegated authority in order to accomplish his master's priorities.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.760
 In chapter 3, we examine the triangle of obligation in 1 Corinthians 9-7-14, skipping

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.600
 verse 12.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.640
 In this chapter, I would like us to return to that verse in order to explore how servanthood

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.160
 shapes Paul's use of his authority, his apostolic prerogative.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.880
 In other words, we'll continue our consideration of servanthood in 1 Corinthians 9-15-22,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.920
 picking up or we left off.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.600
 The right of servanthood.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.480
 Paul's most intense defense of his refusal to accept payment appears in 1 Corinthians 9.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.800
 He presents his decision in the context of Christian liberty, 1 Corinthians 9-19, and his

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.520
 right to receive support.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.320
 If others share this rightful claim on you, do not we even more?

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.320
 Nevertheless, we have not made use of this right, but we endure anything rather than put

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.680
 an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ, 1 Corinthians 9-12.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.400
 This has led some interpreters to decide that Paul arbitrates his policy as a matter of

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.520
 personal choice.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.280
 In other words, it appears as though he has a permissive license to accept payment and

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.520
 return for his preaching.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.720
 But for noble reasons, rejects it.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.840
 At least two considerations should lead us to dismiss this claim.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.080
 First, to say that Paul goes beyond what is required of him is to identify a good course

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.480
 and a better course, and to declare that both are sufficiently pleasing to God.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.240
 This idea is known as super-errogation, and runs contrary to the teaching of the Bible.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.360
 The Lord does not require a minimum bar, but perfection, Matthew 5.48.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.480
 While God may require different things of different people given their strengths and circumstances,

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.200
 each person must serve the Lord as best as he is able.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.120
 Moreover, Jesus summarily dismisses this notion of super-errogation when he points out that

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.360
 no servant of God will be able to say he has done more than was required.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.920
 So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, "We are unworthy servants.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.960
 We have only done what was our duty."

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.100
 Luke 1710.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.000
 If one cannot do more than their duty, we could rule out the idea that it would be acceptable

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.160
 for Paul to accept payment, but better for him to reject it.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.280
 Second, the surrounding context indicates that Paul could still be held guilty for improperly

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.960
 taking support, even if he has a right to that support.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.340
 Paul's mention of his financial policy in 1 Corinthians 9 does not stand on its own,

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.040
 but serves as an illustration to correct the Corinthians' disposition toward idolatry

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.160
 addressed more directly in chapters 8 and 10.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.560
 In these chapters, the Apostle acknowledges the Corinthians' right, 1 Corinthians 8

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:26.080
 9, to food, but instructs them to flee idolatry, 1 Corinthians 10 4.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.040
 It ceased to eat food sacrifice to idols.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.340
 To paraphrase, he describes their actions as lawful but not helpful, 1 Corinthians 10

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.700
 23, meaning that though they have a right to eat, they abuse that right by eating food

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.160
 sacrifice to idols, committing idolatry.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:53.120
 Notice that elsewhere, Paul uses the same distinction between lawful and helpful to describe

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.480
 sexual immorality, 1 Corinthians 6, 12, through 15.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.720
 Christians have a right to use their bodies for sex, but they abuse that right if they sleep

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.760
 with a prostitute.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.560
 In other words, when Paul uses the word right, he does not indicate a permissive license or

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.760
 a legal carte blanche that justifies any course of action.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:21.080
 Rather, he denotes an authority of servanhood that grants the actor freedom to serve the

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.000
 Lord as the Lord requires.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.480
 In other words, he speaks of a stewardship.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.880
 A steward has authority over an estate to do as he determines, but incurs moral guilt

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.120
 when this authority is abused to act contrary to the will of the owner.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.000
 Remember Anne the babysitter?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.880
 She had the right to spend the emergency fund as she chose, but was still guilty when she

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.400
 chose poorly.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.760
 To further illustrate, Adam had steward ship over the whole Garden of Eden, including the

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.240
 tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil, but this authority did not permit him to eat of

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.400
 that tree without penalty.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.360
 Genesis 2, 15-17.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.860
 Likewise, the Corinthians have steward ship over their own bodies to eat food, but would

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:16.360
 abuse that steward ship by eating food offered to demons, 1 Corinthians 10, 20-21.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.600
 As a servant of God, Paul has steward ship over his converts to receive money from them,

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:30.240
 but would abuse that steward ship by receiving payment for a gospel that is not his decel.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.720
 With these considerations in mind, we must conclude that Paul's financial policy does

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:41.600
 not merely represent his own preferences, a personal quirk, but an absolute ethical

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:49.720
 code. His pattern establishes a prescription that binds all who minister in the name of Christ.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.760
 The boast of Servanthood.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:08:00.600
 In 1 Corinthians 9-15-19, Paul lists several reasons for rejecting Corinthian funds, beginning

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.600
 with his desire to maintain grounds for boasting.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.960
 But I have made no use of any of these rights, nor am I writing these things to secure any

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:16.400
 such provision, for I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of my ground for boasting,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.480
 1 Corinthians 9-15.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:25.240
 Of course, boasting in himself would contradict the message of Paul's epistle, 1 Corinthians

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.440
 129-321-47.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:39.280
 As he writes, "Let the one who boasts boasts in the Lord, 1 Corinthians 131, CF 1531."

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:45.800
 With Paul's boasting rests in the Lord independent of himself, then it resides there, unthreatened,

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.600
 secure in an unchanging God.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:54.680
 Yet all the same, he declares that an acceptance of money would jeopardize his boasting.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:00.080
 A fact he confirms in 2 Corinthians 11-7-10.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.080
 In this same context, he repeats the aphorism to boast in the Lord, explaining that he boasts

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.960
 in the ministry God has assigned to him, 2 Corinthians 10-13-17.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:17.040
 In other words, his boasts in the Lord is not independent of himself.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.600
 It has some relation to his ministry.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:27.240
 Thus, an alteration to his fundraising practices potentially alters his boasts.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.160
 If Paul receives direct payments from the Corinthians in exchange for his ministry,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.440
 he receives honor over God as the source of the gospel.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.440
 This would make his own work his grounds for boasting rather than the Lord's work.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:46.720
 If instead he rejects payment and return for the gospel, the apostle acknowledges that

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.280
 its source lies outside of himself.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:57.240
 Respiracy compromises Paul's earnest boasts in the Lord by placing his boasts in himself.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.680
 The obligation of servitude.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.960
 Paul additionally explains that he does not accept funding from the Corinthians because

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.320
 he is bound to minister to them.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.520
 For if I preach the gospel, that gives me no ground for boasting, for necessity is laid

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.520
 upon me.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.080
 Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.160
 First Corinthians 9-16.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:26.120
 Paul is a steward of the mysteries of God and a servant of Christ.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.440
 As of his status as a servant steward, he receives no special accolades for preaching the

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.440
 gospel.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:38.600
 However, if he operates as an independent agent, doing his own will rather than the will

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:47.360
 of God, it would make sense that he receives every word, direct payment from others.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.080
 In the same way, it is improper for a royal soldier to accept money from the citizens

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.680
 he protects.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.120
 He has first Corinthians 9-7.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:02.760
 His commission from the king delegitimizes all other compensatory transactions.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:08.000
 If he demands funding from the common man, as though their taxes are owed to him rather

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.400
 than the throne, he may be found guilty of extortion.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:18.160
 Even if he only accepts voluntary offerings of support, he engages in bribery.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:24.000
 Ultimately, the soldier who accepts any form of direct payment from the citizens ceases

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.400
 to operate on behalf of the king as one who is obligated, but begins acting in his own

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.480
 interest as one who does his work freely.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:39.160
 Similarly, if Paul were to accept money from the Corinthians as direct, i.e.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:44.880
 unmediated, payment for his ministry there, he would invalidate his status as a servant

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.880
 of Christ.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:52.480
 As one commissioned by God, Paul cannot rightly accept third-party compensation and direct

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.200
 exchange for his ministry, cf.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.880
 2 Corinthians 217.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.240
 Such reciprocity denotes an insincere stewardship.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.800
 However, through the Dory Imprinciple, he may accept funds that are not designated to

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.440
 displace his true employer.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.600
 Co-labor and no way invalidates Paul's status as a servant.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.960
 Rather, we should anticipate that servants of the same master assist each other, pulling

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.200
 their resources as would be profitable and service of their mutual lord.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.040
 The reward of Servant Hood.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.960
 And the next two verses, Paul explains that he conducts his ministry as he does in order

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.440
 to receive a reward.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.080
 For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.600
 But if not of my own will, I am still entrusted with a stewardship.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.800
 But then is my reward.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.960
 That in my preaching, I may present the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.080
 of my right in the gospel.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.920
 1 Corinthians 9 17 through 18.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.560
 Surprisingly, Paul's activity and reward are identical.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.800
 To preach the gospel free of charge.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.640
 The idea is not that the apostle by refusing money accrues merit with which he will receive

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.640
 a reward.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.800
 Instead, by refusing money, he enjoys the reward itself.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.000
 The stewardship he executes.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.720
 Christ working through him.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:28.480
 Given the preceding context of boasting, 1 Corinthians 9 15 through 16, we should not distinguish

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.360
 Paul's boasting from his reward.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.920
 And the words of one commentator, they refer to the same reality.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:41.240
 In either the framework of boasting or that of reward, Paul stands to gain from preaching

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.400
 free of charge because then Christ may be seen working through him.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:53.000
 In contrast, if Paul were to receive payment, his reward would be the payment itself.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.880
 He would operate as a voluntary laborer, setting his own fees so he would no longer function

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.800
 as a servant bound by his master.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.000
 The F. John 718.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.680
 Accepting financial reward would forfeit the greater reward, godly stewardship.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.400
 This recalls the teaching of Christ and the servant on the mount.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.560
 Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.120
 synagogues and in the streets that they may be praised by others.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.840
 Truly I say to you, they have received the reward.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:34.320
 And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.960
 that their fasting may be seen by others.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.160
 Truly I say to you, they have received the reward.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.600
 Matthew 6 to 16.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.240
 Using this construct, we may paraphrase Paul.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.680
 When you minister, do not be like the hypocrites who do so for payment.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:58.480
 Truly I say to you, they have received the reward.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.800
 Thus the term hypocrit seems to charge for the context of 1 Corinthians 9.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.320
 But is not this precisely what he communicates?

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:12.520
 The one who receives reciprocity does not operate as a sincere servant of Christ, but as

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.760
 a free agent after his own reward.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:21.280
 On the other hand, the one who receives co-labor enjoys financial benefits within the auspices

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.320
 of stewardship, a greater reward than mere money.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.720
 The scope of servanthood.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:35.920
 And perhaps the most defining passage in 1 Corinthians 9, Paul proclaims that he has

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.920
 become all things to all people.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:45.160
 For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.160
 of them.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.280
 To the Jews I became as a Jew in order to win Jews.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:55.600
 To those under the law I became as one under the law, though not being myself under the

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.320
 law, that I might win those under the law.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:05.400
 To those outside the law I became as one outside the law, not being outside the law of God,

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.320
 but under the law of Christ.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.000
 That I might win those outside the law.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.080
 To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:19.160
 I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:24.680
 1 Corinthians 9 19-22 Paul does not speak of making the gospel

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.120
 more attractive.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:31.520
 He has already admitted that the gospel itself is a stumbling block, on appealing to the world.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.120
 1 Corinthians 1-23.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.640
 And that he has a shoot, typical means of attraction and persuasion.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.480
 1 Corinthians 2-1-5.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:47.640
 Furthermore, rather than stirring up good will through offering the gospel free of charge,

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:53.280
 we learn in 2 Corinthians that Paul only stirred up tension as those with more financially

00:16:53.280 --> 00:17:00.600
 glorious ministries turned the people away to different teaching 2 Corinthians 11-7.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.880
 Between a free gospel and one offered at a price, the Corinthians, who so valued wealth

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:12.520
 and status in their leaders, found a ladder more enticing.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:18.120
 While many have read 1 Corinthians 9 to speak of Paul's contextualizing of the gospel,

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.400
 something more specific is at play.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.760
 Each of these phrases of accommodation represents some act of humility.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.880
 Though already a Jew, the Apostle voluntarily became a Jew under the judgment of the law

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:35.760
 by receiving 39 lashes, 2 Corinthians 11-24.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:41.680
 He became as one without the law, renouncing all of his own merit based on law keeping.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.280
 Galatians 4-12.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:49.680
 He became weak by enduring the hardships and humiliations of ministry, 2 Corinthians 12-9.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:55.800
 These accommodations impress no one yet are necessary for the gospel to go forward.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.560
 The key to all of this may be found in verse 19.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:06.920
 Paul does not imitate all, but rather humbles himself in order to serve all.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:13.680
 As a servant of Christ, Paul must also be a servant to those to whom he is sent 2 Corinthians

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.960
 4-5, C.F. 124.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:22.480
 He does not generally act like a Jew for Jews, or a Gentile for Gentiles, or a weak person

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:28.320
 for the weak, but he is a servant to all in every circumstance by humbling himself so

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.920
 that the truth of the gospel may be properly acknowledged.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:37.760
 We should not be misguided by the Apostle's clever rhetorical device, so as to imagine

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:44.560
 that he would become popular for the popular, strong for the strong, or rich for the rich.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:48.240
 The same applies to Paul's rejection of money.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.640
 First-century Corinth bustles with economic prosperity, and certainly some of the wealthy

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.160
 filled the ranks in the church.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.600
 C.F. 1 Corinthians 4-8.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:03.480
 So Paul does not reject financial support out of a desire to blend in.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.960
 He does not make himself attractive to the people of Corinth.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.960
 As we have seen, accepting their money would have made him more attractive.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:17.160
 Rather, he humbles himself so that he might fulfill the role of a servant.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.720
 Here sincerity and rejection of reciprocity go hand in hand.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:28.160
 If Paul were to accept payment from the Corinthians, he would not be their servant, but a service provider,

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.440
 and they his clients.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:35.840
 Whether or not he requests money, his ministry would be understood to impose an obligation

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.520
 that requires a settling of accounts.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:45.200
 However, the apostle may freely accept material support from co-laborers without compromising

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.400
 his position.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.600
 Conclusion

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.800
 The duty of Servanthood demands the Dory Imprinciple.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:20:00.240
 As a servant, Paul must reject ministerial reciprocity, and he must accept ministerial

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.080
 co-labor.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:09.560
 And the next chapter we will look at Paul's motivations through an additional lens, his sincerity.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.560
 End of chapter 5

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:18.040
 End of chapter 5
