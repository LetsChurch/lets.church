00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 The Dorian Principle, a biblical response to the commercialization of Christianity by

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:15.840
 Conley Owens, Chapter 10, The Testimony of History, Claim vs Evidence.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.040
 In 2008, Tom Biscardi snagged a significant amount of camera time when he claimed that

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.360
 he had discovered the carcass of a Sasquatch.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.240
 Someone had finally found Bigfoot, except he had not.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.480
 Rather predictably, the animal turned out to be nothing more than a rubber costume shoved

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.960
 into a freezer.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.620
 I suppose there will always be believers in Bigfoot, but I am relatively certain no such

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.920
 creature exists.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.960
 No one has ever found the beast or captured convincing video of it.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.320
 What's more, no one has ever found an authentic Sasquatch track or even Sasquatch droppings.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.760
 Things that exist leave traces of their existence.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.360
 It's a simple fact of reality.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.240
 A claim is only a claim apart from evidence.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.520
 Similarly, true apostolic practices leave their mark on the church.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.400
 If the Dorian Principle was practiced by the apostles in the first century, we should

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.360
 expect to see traces of this practice in the second century.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.480
 Even if the church experienced times of radical transition, we should expect to see some evidence

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.040
 of this ethic.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.880
 I believe that when we look to the pages of history, that is exactly what we find.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.560
 In the last chapter, we examine the practice of the Dorian Principle in the first century

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.880
 church.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.960
 In this chapter, we will examine its practice in the following century.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.520
 After establishing the second century church fully embraced this ethic, we will briefly

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.760
 look at how the Protestant Reformation attempted to recapture it.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.000
 The Didikai

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.120
 Quite possibly the oldest extrabiblical Christian writing, the Didikai functions as a manual of church

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.620
 practice.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:15.440
 Also known as the Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, it attempts to capture apostolic doctrine

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.920
 and the practice of the church into an orderly guide.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.760
 Despite these lofty goals, it draws from Matthew to the exclusion of the other gospels,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.640
 and possibly to the exclusion of all other New Testament books.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.760
 This document does not attempt to forge new ground or expand upon previous revelation,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.560
 but only to apply what had already been provided by available scripture.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.440
 However, this is largely to our advantage since we have founded our own understanding of

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.920
 Biblical fundraising ethics on Matthew 10-8-10.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.000
 In other words, the Didikai helps us answer the question, "How did the early church apply

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.840
 Jesus' words in Matthew?"

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.440
 The Didikai's importance stems largely from its early authorship, dating to the mid to

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.880
 late first century.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.680
 The primitive simplicity of the Didikai's teaching, as well as its silence on persecution,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.400
 provide the strongest arguments for a first century date.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.520
 However, perhaps the early date should not impress us as much as the respected garnered

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.560
 from the early church.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.560
 For example, the early church historian Eusebius lists the Didikai among true Orthodox writings,

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.440
 and Athanasius, the early theologian who defended the doctrine of the Trinity, includes

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.080
 it among books approved for baptismal candidates.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.360
 Additionally, the Didikai appears to be referenced by Clement of Alexandria and other early Christian

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.280
 witnesses, Ignatius arguably being among their ranks.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.200
 This support for the Didikai confirms that it largely represents the early church's

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.200
 understanding of the practical matters it addresses.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.000
 Given this brief overview of the document, we can conclude with some degree of confidence

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.680
 that where the Didikai offers guidance on ministry fundraising.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.600
 Its instruction emerges from an evaluation of New Testament sources, and that its judgments

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.720
 were largely shared by the early 2nd century church.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.880
 Further, given its early date, one may reasonably conclude that its prescriptions do not stray

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.640
 far from the practice of the Apostolic Church.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.640
 At most, it represents a minor evolution from the original pattern of the church, rather

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.600
 than a freshly designed program.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.080
 With that in mind, we turn to the relevant text.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.320
 Let every Apostle, when he cometh to you, be it received as the Lord, but he shall not

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.160
 abide more than a single day, or if there be need, a second likewise, but if he abide

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.520
 three days, he is a false prophet, and when he departed, let the Apostle received nothing

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.840
 save bread until he find his shelter.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.680
 And if he asks money, he is a false prophet.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.440
 And whoever shall say in the Spirit, give me silver or anything else, you shall not listen

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.600
 to him.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.160
 But if he tell you to give on behalf of others that are in want, let no man judge him.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.480
 Didikai11.4-6-12.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.720
 Clearly, the Didikai takes serious precautions against itinerant teachers who would take advantage

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.600
 of the church.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.560
 In a different context, it labels anyone who wrongly accepts the support of the Christian

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:43.000
 community, a trafficker in Christ, or Christmonger, didikai12.5.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.160
 We may identify several prohibitions here.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.160
 1.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.000
 Staying in a home for three or more days.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.520
 2.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.160
 Taking more than bread for one's journey.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.840
 3.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.240
 Taking for money for one's journey.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.320
 On the surface, several points stand at odds with our conclusion from the former chapters.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.520
 Benjamin Franklin quiped that fish and visitors stink after three days.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.960
 But beyond this humor, it is not clear why there would be a prohibition against prolonged

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.560
 hospitality.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.960
 Especially if Paul is willing to spend the entire winter with the Corinthians.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:32.400
 The ban on accepting money for a journey likewise seems out of step with the previous covered

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.720
 notion of pro-Pimpos support.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.800
 The confusion arises from the fact that the Didikai speaks to an established Christian

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.720
 people, yet appears to prohibit them from co-laboring.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:49.800
 However, clarity arises from recognizing that this paragraph addresses a profit of questionable

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.400
 veracity.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.200
 Didikai11.13.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.360
 Visitors are to recognize him as a true profit, in part, by the ethic he exhibits in managing

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.120
 his own support among unknown people.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.000
 Prior to such a demonstration, the people should treat him with a healthy caution.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.760
 Regarding one firmly identified as a true profit, the Didikai readily acknowledges that

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:20.440
 he is worthy of his food, Didikai13.1, and deserves the first fruit of money, possessions,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.440
 etc.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.440
 Didikai13.7.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:30.080
 Since we have seen these instructions most clearly pronounced in the epistles of Paul, I find

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.480
 it especially fascinating that the author of the Didikai apparently arises at these conclusions

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.640
 apart from a clear knowledge of the Apostles writings.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.760
 In other words, the Didikai indicates that Jesus established a Dorian Principle, and that

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:50.520
 it may be understood in the Gospel of Matthew without appealing to any later developments.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.800
 Prior to Paul's rejection of hospitality when arriving in Corinth, Thessalonica, in Ephesus,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.600
 the church understood that it is unbecoming for a minister of Christ to support himself

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.880
 by receiving direct payment from his converts.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.640
 The Shepherd of Hermas

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.800
 A similar, albeit more specific, concern arises in the Shepherd of Hermas.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.840
 As with the Didikai, the Shepherd is a Christian writing that was widely respected by the early

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.040
 church.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.720
 Once again, this indicates that its judgments are largely representative of those held by

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.120
 the early church, reflecting the Council's scripture.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.600
 The Shepherd of Hermas warns against greedy prophets who willingly say anything for the

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.960
 sake of gain, Shepherd 43.233.8.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:44.800
 As a precautionary measure against such things, it decries private prophecy, demanding

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:51.800
 that teachers teach plainly and openly in a Christian assembly, Shepherd 43.13 through

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.800
 14.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:58.400
 However, perhaps its most direct rebuk of false prophets comes in the form of a condemnation

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.880
 of ministerial reciprocity.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:07.840
 In the first place, that man who seemed to have a spirit exalted himself, and desire to

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.840
 have a chief place, and straight way he is impudent and shameless and talkative and

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:19.080
 conversant in many luxuries, and in many other deceits and receiveeth money for his prophesying.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.160
 And if he receiveeth not, he prophesiedeth not.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.120
 Now can a divine spirit receive money and prophesy?

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:32.920
 It is not possible for a prophet of God to do this, but the spirit of such prophets is

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.720
 earthly, Shepherd 43.12.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.600
 And forbidding the requirement of remuneration, the Shepherd does not clearly prohibit the

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.680
 acceptance of remuneration.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:50.320
 However, it goes on and say that a divine spirit cannot receive money and prophesy.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:56.440
 Here, the Shepherd offers an unqualified rejection of ministerial reciprocity.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:02.960
 It rejects as insincere any who would receive in direct exchange for teaching.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.960
 Apolognes

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.040
 Not much is known of apolognes of Ephesus, but his writings warrant mention for their status

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.960
 as early Christian witnesses to the practices of the church.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:19.320
 These writings no longer exist in a complete form, but the early church historian Eusebius

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:26.800
 recorded his contensions with the heretic mountainous of mountainous apolognes reports.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.440
 This is he who appointed collectors of money, who contrived the receiving of gifts under

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:37.640
 the name of offerings, who provided salaries for those who preached his doctrine, that

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.960
 its teaching might prevail through gluttony.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:46.920
 Clearly, apolognes opposes greedy accumulation of wealth, although it is less clear why he

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.720
 objects to salaries in particular.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:54.120
 It seems likely that he protests the nature of the commission, pay offered in return for

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.480
 preaching.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:01.600
 Regardless, it is plain that apolognes opposes prophets accepting gifts in the context

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.120
 of their ministry.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:09.360
 Thus not all scriptures seem to you to forbid a prophet to receive gifts in money.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:15.360
 When therefore I see the prophetess Priska receiving gold in silver and costly garments,

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.680
 how can I avoid reproving her?

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:22.760
 If they deny that their prophets have received gifts, let them acknowledge this, that if they

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:27.720
 are convicted of receiving them, they are not prophets.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.240
 Notably, apolognes appeals to Christ as he promotes his ethic.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.300
 For although the Lord said to provide neither gold nor silver, neither two coats, these men

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:44.400
 in complete opposition transgress in respect to the possession of the forbidden things, for

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:49.640
 we will show that those whom they call prophets and martyrs gather their gain not only from

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:55.280
 rich men, but also from the poor and orphans and widows.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.280
 Depending on how we understand apolognes, one could argue that he strays from the Dorian

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.360
 principle, rejecting all financial support for ministers rather than merely rejecting ministerial

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.040
 reciprocity.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.920
 However, congregational support has always been a common feature in churches, even in the

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.160
 first and second century.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.640
 For apolognes to take particular issue with mountainous, the false prophets practice must

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:26.880
 have deviated beyond the typical practice, possessing a more commercial character.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.800
 Regardless, apolognes appeals to the common understanding of the church and points to

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.840
 some divergent practice in the set of mountainous.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.680
 Whether apolognes' biblical understanding is accurate or not, it represents the second

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:47.560
 century Christian mindset, which was formed in influence by first century Christian practices.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:53.560
 In other words, even apart from perfect agreement, these objections to payment confirm the

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:58.560
 second century church affirmed something akin to the Dorian principle.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.880
 Those familiar with church history might know that in the course of his contending against

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:09.000
 mountainous, apolognes incurred the rebuke of Tertullian, one of the most important second

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.880
 century theologians.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:17.760
 But on this point, the two were agreed, as Tertullian writes, "There is no buying and selling

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.120
 of any sort in the things of God."

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:26.640
 Martin Luther flash forward to the Protestant Reformation.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.440
 In the first three centuries of the church, we see the ripples and echoes of the Dorian principle

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.160
 in play.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:38.440
 But the 16th century concerns us for an altogether different reason.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:45.360
 The eventual corruption of the church had led to a degradation in fundraising practices.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.320
 Rather than having the opportunity to maintain the apostolic practice, the reformers found

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:55.240
 themselves saddled with the task of restoring a biblical view of money.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:00.680
 In fact, while the Reformation centered around the doctrines of scripture and salvation,

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:06.960
 the relationship between money and ministry was arguably the primary catalyst of the Reformation.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:14.480
 In the early 16th century, the sale of indulgences, reductions on time spent in purgatory, financed

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.480
 the construction of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:24.920
 In Germany, this effort was led by Johann Tetzel, a friar whose marketing skills have been

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:31.120
 immortalized in the following couplet, as soon as a coin in the coffer rings, a soul from

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.320
 purgatory to heaven springs.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:43.120
 German priest Martin Luther, 1483–1546, objected to this commercial treatment of salvation.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:51.080
 And on October 31, 1517, he nailed his 95 feces against the sale of indulgences to the

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.800
 door of all Saints Church in Wittenberg.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:00.200
 This act of defiance sparked the Protestant Reformation, the largest religious and cultural

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:05.560
 revolution the Western world had ever experienced.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:10.440
 Luther believed the minister was obligated to be selfless in his office and saw the calling

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:15.680
 of pastor to be one of the imitation of Christ in his sacrifice.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:21.280
 Concerning the Pope, he writes, "Is it not his duty to do all that he can for all Christians

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:28.120
 without reward solely for God's sake, may even to shed his blood for them?"

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:33.280
 He goes as far as to say that a ministry endeavor that seeks to raise money lacks the marks

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.600
 of divine approval.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:42.360
 As we see, every project of men bears money, the word of God bears nothing but the cross.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:47.960
 Of course, Luther also believes ministers should receive regular support in order to sustain

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.800
 the proclamation of the gospel.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:56.200
 On one hand, it seems clear that Luther roughly affirmed the Dorean principle, denying that

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.320
 the message of salvation should be sold after affirming that congregants should support

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.880
 their ministers.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:07.880
 However, his writings never ventured much farther than a rebuke of extremes.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:13.480
 Other figures in the Protestant Reformation voiced similar concerns, but in my estimation,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:18.440
 none ever made it quite as far as to articulate a robust ethic distinguishing the wrongful

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.680
 and rightful receipt of money in ministry.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.200
 Conclusion

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.760
 Looking back on the pages of history, we see that the second century church maintained

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.600
 the apostolic practice of the Dorean principle.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:39.240
 Moreover, they understood this ethic to be a scriptural precept, defending it largely

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.640
 from the gospel of Matthew.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.360
 Unlike Bigfoot, the teaching of the Dorean principle in the first century church left traces

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.640
 in the following century that corroborates its prevalence among the churches founded

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.000
 by the apostles.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.640
 Later, after centuries of increased disregard in the church at large, the reformers recognized

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.720
 the need to restore a biblical ethic of ministry fundraising.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:09.760
 By and large, they determined that scripture forbids the sale of ministry, and yet commands

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.760
 the support of ministers.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:19.440
 However, these reformers were largely satisfied to counter the extremes of greed and neglect.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:24.120
 The work begun at the time of the Reformation remains in need of completion.

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.600
 For those who wish to take up that mantle, I believe that the Dorean principle holds

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:36.400
 the keys to properly articulating the biblical ethic and putting it into practice.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.320
