00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120
 The Dorian Principle, a biblical response to the commercialization of Christianity by

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:18.280
 Conley Owens, Chapter 3, the Triangle of Obligation, Inmedia-C versus Indirection.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.160
 I was 23 years old and I never met my Lolo.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.840
 That's the Tagalog word for grandfather.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.800
 Several factors, including the entimely death of my mother, his daughter, as well as

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.720
 his roots in the Philippines left us distant and without common ties.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.020
 Driving a stereo-less Honda Accord and armed with the return address on a letter I had

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.460
 received 12 years prior, I set off on a 2,400 mile road trip with the hope of connecting

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.080
 with them.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.440
 The overall journey had a larger purpose.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.600
 I was moving from Virginia to California, but this was an essential side quest.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.020
 As I investigated the neighborhood, I discovered the house had belonged to a sister.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.420
 Some of the neighbors were still in touch with her, and she was able to give me a touch

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.260
 with him.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.440
 He only visited the United States a few weeks a year, and by God's providence it just

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.740
 so happened that he would be arriving shortly.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.040
 When the time came, I was equipped with the new address, and headed off to meet my Lolo.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.600
 It was a sweet reunion, if first time meetings between relatives may be called reunions.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.280
 I not only had the privilege of meeting him, but several other relatives, including his

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.880
 oldest son, my uncle, Titoji.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.120
 Titoji's hospitality was fantastic.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.420
 He housed me for several days, and hardly a moment passed where food was not being prepared

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.920
 or offered to me.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.880
 In part, this is par for the course in Filipino homes, but as I spoke with him, I learned that

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.120
 he felt the need to treat me well in order to honor my mother, the sister he had never

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.120
 met.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.840
 Needless to say, that weekend remains one of the most memorable in my life.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.760
 Titoji considered himself obligated to me, but only indirectly so.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.880
 Rather than an immediate or direct indebtedness, his felt obligation toward me.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.000
 Was mediated through my late mother.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.520
 Visually, we might picture this as a triangle.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.440
 In the first two chapters, we saw that both Jesus and Paul forbid receiving ministerial support

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.240
 out of a direct obligation, reciprocity, but encouraged support that arises out of a

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.280
 mediated obligation, co-labor.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.320
 This ethic, the Dorian principle, fits into the same sort of triangle.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.320
 I would like to use that notion of mediated obligation as a lens by which we will examine

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.240
 a broader collection of examples.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.000
 Specifically, in 1 Corinthians 9, Paul reinforces this principle of co-labor through several

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.160
 analogies to ministry fundraising.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.440
 Let's take a look at these and see how this pattern takes shape.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.200
 The priesthood.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.920
 The last analogy that Paul employs is in many ways the most direct of the lot.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.120
 According to the Apostle, the general principles of ministerial maintenance in Old Testament

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.000
 Israel must carry over into the New Testament Church.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.720
 Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.640
 the temple and those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings?

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.880
 In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.840
 living by the gospel, 1 Corinthians 9, 13, through 14.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.960
 Paul appeals to the pattern established by the Levitical priesthood while we have started

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.920
 our investigation of ministers and money with the words of Christ and the acts of Paul.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.000
 This will take us back to the earliest pages of the Bible to see how God provided for

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.120
 his laborers.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.360
 The law of Moses specifies the Levites received the food from the Lord's food offering.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.600
 Numbers 18, 8 through 20, Deuteronomy 18, 1 through 5.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.480
 Everything contributed but not burned becomes the possession of the sons of Aaron.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:32.160
 The Leviticus 2, 1 through 3, 7, 33 to 35.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.160
 Similarly to the contributions of the food offerings, the same book of law records the

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.560
 right of the Levites to the Tithes composed of the produce of the land and other valuable

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.560
 materials.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.440
 Numbers 18, 21 through 24.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.920
 While the tribe as a whole only nominally inherits the food offerings, the Tiths are in fact

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.440
 shared this broadly.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.920
 On one hand, it appears that this transaction between the citizens at large and the priestly

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.440
 tribe constitutes an expression of obligation of the people of Israel to the Levites.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.040
 It is repeatedly term a perpetual due from the former party to the latter.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.800
 Numbers 18, 8, 11, 19.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.720
 And in practical terms, this due is given directly to the priests.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.920
 Deuteronomy 18, 3.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:33.320
 However, the transaction is not primarily horizontal as may be easily recognized from

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.040
 its designation as an offering to the Lord.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.400
 And the passages cited above, the sacrifices are called the contributions made to me, the

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.160
 Lord, Numbers 18, 8, and the Lord's food offerings, Deuteronomy 18, 1.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:56.560
 The Lord likewise labels the Tithes a contribution to the Lord, Numbers 18, 24.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.200
 While the Tith and offerings are given to the Lord, the book of Numbers also says they are

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:12.280
 given by the Lord, Numbers 18, 8, 12, 19, 21, 24.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.240
 These two primary directions of flow must control our understanding of the secondary direction

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.000
 of flow.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.440
 The Israelites give to the Levites, but more importantly, the Israelites give to God who

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.080
 in turn gives to the Levites.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.760
 After all, we would not imagine the people of Israel making their sacrifices to mere men.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:39.440
 To speak of resources passing from man to man simply abbreviates the larger transaction.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.560
 As the Lord says to the Levites in Numbers 18, 12, "The first fruits of what they give to

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.640
 the Lord, I give to you."

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.160
 Note that the expressed significance of the phrase "the Lord is their inheritance," resides

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.840
 in this arrangement between the Levites and their Israelite brothers.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.480
 Numbers 18, 20, C.F. Deuteronomy 18, 1 through 2.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.760
 On one hand, this simply acknowledges what we have already identified.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.200
 The Lord provides for the Levites.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.960
 On another hand, it shows the exclusivity of this mode of support.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.360
 It is not merely that the Levites are to have the Lord as an inheritance, receiving from

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.120
 the contributions, but they are to have no other inheritance.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:32.040
 The law of Moses permits the priest to receive co-labor, that which is offered to the Lord,

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.640
 but forbids reciprocity.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:41.280
 Consequently, in Israel's times of faithlessness, i.e. when they do not co-labor, the Levites

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:49.360
 languish, C.F. Deuteronomy 1427, Nehemiah 1310.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.920
 Perhaps the Levites may find other means of sustaining themselves, but in the context of

00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:00.320
 their ministry, the Levites forfeit the typical modes of sustenance enjoyed by other tribes.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.360
 For the sake of the divine blessing, they do not engage in property accrual, and they do

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:11.200
 not exchange their services for payment.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.560
 When this model is violated, and a priest accepts offerings directly, he essentially puts

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.120
 himself in the place of God.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:25.040
 As a divinely appointed broker, he disseminates the Lord's blessings through the work of ministry,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.000
 but then robs from the Lord what is owed in return.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.840
 Such was the sin of Hophany of Phineas, the corrupt sons of Samuel, who took raw meat before

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.920
 it had been offered to the Lord.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:42.040
 First Samuel 2, 12th through 17.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:47.080
 This model keenly foreshadows the tensions and resolutions we have seen in the Gospels.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:53.320
 Jesus forbids payment for ministry, reciprocity, but insists that workers are to receive from

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:58.920
 other members of the kingdom as wages from God, co-labor.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.800
 False metaphors.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:07.280
 In addition to his reference to the Levitical priesthood, Paul makes several other analogies

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.360
 that exhibit the same pattern of mediated obligation.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.600
 Who serves as a soldier at his own expense?

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.280
 Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit?

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.920
 Or who tends a flock without getting some of the milk?

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.760
 Do I say these things on human authority?

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.400
 Does not the law say the same?

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.800
 Or does written in the law of Moses?

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.240
 You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.760
 Is it for oxen that God is concerned?

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.760
 Does he not certainly speak for our sake?

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:44.080
 It was written for our sake because the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher, thresh,

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.320
 in hope of sharing the crop.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.880
 First Corinthians 9, 7-10.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.400
 While an initial reading may lead one to imagine Paul describing a direct obligation

00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:01.560
 between man and minister, a brief contemplation of his various metaphors revealed that, in each

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.960
 case, the obligation is mediated.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.680
 And each, the one who gives is not the employer who contractually pays, but simply the source

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.960
 of material provision used to supply the laborer.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:20.960
 And each, the one who gives is not primarily obligated to the laborer, but to the laborer's

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.400
 employer.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.600
 The vine does not supply out of obligation to the vine dresser, and the citizen does not

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.400
 supply out of obligation to the soldier.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.800
 The former supplies out of obligation to the owner, and the latter out of obligation to

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.240
 the king.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:42.920
 Representing the Lord, the owner and the king ultimately reward the laborer by a sorted

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.560
 means of provision.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:50.840
 Likewise, the laborer commissioned by God does not ultimately receive his pay from those

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.600
 to whom he ministers, even if he receives it at their hands.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.520
 His just reward is granted by God through human means.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:05.600
 His just reward is granted through co-labor, not reciprocity.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.600
 Widows

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.360
 This passage leads us to another parallel.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.880
 The church's provision for widows.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:18.920
 The connection may not be immediately obvious, but in 1 Timothy 5, Paul once again cites

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:24.000
 the ox and the law of Moses, along with the words of Christ in order to illustrate the nature

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 of the church's obligation to ministers.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.120
 Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.520
 in preaching and teaching.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:41.480
 For the scripture says, "You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain, and

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.840
 the laborer deserves his wages."

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:51.000
 In the New Testament, the term "honor" to "may" in Greek, frequently denotes price

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.400
 or value.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:12:02.280
 CF Matthew 27, 6 through 9, Acts 4, 34, 5, 2 through 3.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:08.480
 As in English, where we speak of the honorarium paid to a speaker, some take this injunction

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.720
 of double honor to mean that those elders who preach and teach should receive double

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.240
 the pay received by other elders.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.400
 However, notice that the verse says no such thing.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:27.680
 Rather, it says all elders who rule well should be counted worthy of double honor.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:33.240
 Those who preach and teach are simply exemplars among the single group.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:38.080
 So if the term "double" does not imply a comparison between teaching and non-teaching

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.080
 elders, what does it compare?

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:46.560
 The key to this is found earlier in the chapter where Paul commands that another demographic

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.680
 in the church receive honor.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.280
 Honor widows who are truly widows.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.920
 Let a widow be enrolled if she is not less than 60 years of age having been the wife of

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.720
 one husband and having a reputation for good works.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:06.800
 If she has brought up children, as shown hospitality, has washed the feet of saints, has cared

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.000
 for the afflicted, and has devoted herself to every good work.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.040
 Verse Timothy 5-3 9-10

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.840
 Paul instructs Timothy to honor, to Molo in Greek, the widows.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:27.960
 That is, he should enroll them in some program where they will receive regular financial support

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.880
 in correlation with their service to the church.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.840
 However, one would not imagine that the widows are being paid in direct exchange for their

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.440
 works.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.080
 With this were the case.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:44.360
 The exclusion of widows with families would be unjust, verse Timothy 4-5.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.720
 "Rather, and their need, they are to be honored as servants of God by less needy servants

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.720
 of God."

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:57.280
 That is, the church does not find itself directly obligated to widows for their service, otherwise

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:03.400
 they would pay all widows, but finds itself obligated to God who commands its needy servants,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.400
 be spared the shame of destitution.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:13.000
 Even that Paul relates the honoring of widows to the honoring of elders, this triangle of obligation

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.080
 must shape our understanding of how church leaders are to be compensated.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:25.960
 The notion of co-lapur, present in the support of widows, must be present in the support of elders.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.040
 Jerusalem

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:34.100
 Back in 1 Corinthians 9, between the little bitical priesthood and the other six analogies, Paul

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.880
 makes the following comment.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.840
 If we have so-and-spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material things

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.160
 from you?

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.840
 1 Corinthians 9-11.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:51.280
 This bear is remarkable similarity to something the apostle says regarding the Jerusalem collection,

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:57.240
 a financial collection among Gentile churches for the poor in Jerusalem.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.640
 For the Gentile churches were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to the church in

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.240
 Jerusalem.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.520
 Or if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they also ought to be

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.720
 of service to them in material blessings.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.640
 Romans 1527

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.560
 By using the same language to discuss these issues, Paul frames the Jerusalem collection as

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.360
 a matter of ministerial support.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:26.800
 This leaves us with one more analogous triangle to examine.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.640
 Paul regards the Gentiles as deaders who owe the Jews, yet he treats the collection as

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:37.800
 an act of worship, demonstrating immediate obligation owed primarily to God.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:43.640
 For example, he orders that people gather for this offering on the Christian day of worship,

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:50.080
 the first day of the week, 1 Corinthians 1612, 1 Corinthians 162.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:57.680
 Furthermore, he describes the offering with vocabulary, Greek, La Torgia, that indicates

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.000
 a religious service.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.480
 Romans 1527

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:11.120
 In fact, in 2 Corinthians offering a primary motivation for participation in the collection,

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.800
 Paul points to the Father's gift of the Son and the Son's willing sacrifice of his life.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.520
 2 Corinthians 8.9

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.520
 CF 913

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.520
 15

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:27.640
 In other words, the Gentiles owe this gift to the Lord and are to offer it by sharing

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.240
 it with his needy servants.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:35.160
 It is a religious sacrifice rendered to God rather than to the Jews, just as it generates

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:42.640
 thanks to God rather than to the Gentiles, 2 Corinthians 9, 11 through 12.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:48.440
 There exists a real obligation here between Gentile and Jew, but the Lord mediates that

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.680
 obligation.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.680
 The Gentiles do not give the payment to the Jews for services performed, but offer

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.800
 co-labor a mutual facilitation of kingdom sustenance.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.800
 Conclusion

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:07.760
 In 1 Corinthians 9, Paul confirms the pattern of mediated obligation that we saw in the

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.040
 first two chapters.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:16.080
 Through various analogies of nature and society, he unmistakably replicates his triangle.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:22.360
 Additionally, he draws the analogy more directly when he illustrates the nature of this obligation

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:27.520
 with the Levitical priesthood and the church in Jerusalem.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:33.280
 And the next chapter, we will see how Paul addresses the importance of this mediated obligation

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.800
 with his use of the term burden.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:40.480
 However, if at this point you are eager to learn more about practical application of

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:47.800
 the Dory Imprinciple, feel free to look through chapters 11 through 14 before continuing.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.800
 End of chapter 3
