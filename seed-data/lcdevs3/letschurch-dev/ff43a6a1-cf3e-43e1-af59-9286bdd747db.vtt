00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
 The Dorian Principle A Biblical response to the commercialization

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.160
 of Christianity by Conley Owens.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.840
 Chapter 2 The Policy of Paul Contradiction vs. Consistency

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.560
 I have known many who express a fondness for the TV series in CIS.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.520
 Although I have never watched a full episode, I have enjoyed several clips from the show

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.240
 featuring hacking scenes.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.840
 In the most fantastic of them all, two characters attempt to stop the hacker who has gained access

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.280
 to their computer and act which for some reason manifests as a series of pop-up windows appearing

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.560
 on the screen.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.780
 To work as quickly as possible, both heroes type on the keyboard at the same time, scanning

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.160
 through lines of source code that intermittently appear on the screen.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.440
 However, the hacker has finally stopped by a third hero who, and an act of common-sense

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.200
 genius, thinks to unplug the monitor.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.280
 From personal and professional experience, let me tell you that computer security does

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.680
 not even remotely work this way.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.640
 From blunders like this come the phrase "right what you know" that is, the best kind of writing

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.080
 originates from some author who shares real experience in the subject matter.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.960
 It is unlikely the creators of NCIS had any deep background in computing.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.360
 Unlike some, the Apostle Paul was a man who wrote about what he knew.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.120
 Being personally trained by Gameliel, a master of the Jewish religion, and Jesus, the master

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:57.080
 of Christianity, Paul knew much of faith in God and the doctrines he expounded in his epistles.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.400
 This was no less the case when it came to ministry fundraising.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.720
 In this arena, Paul had experienced more than any of Jesus' early disciples.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.040
 The most prolific among the Apostles, Paul incurred sizeable financial needs.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:22.120
 One scholar has estimated that even the production of an epistle like Romans would cost $2,275

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.520
 in present-day dollars.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:33.040
 Naturally, Paul must have frequently contemplated the flow of money in gospel labor.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.040
 If you have not previously investigated the matter of ministry fundraising, the frequency

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.680
 with which Paul addresses the topic may astound you.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.760
 While Paul addresses some other topics of weighty significance rarely, for example, the Lord

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.960
 Supper, he frequently makes mention of fundraising practices.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.600
 Beyond those texts regarding the collection for the poor in Jerusalem, Major Pericope

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:10.600
 include the entirety of 1 Corinthians 9, 2 Corinthians 111-15, 1 Thessalonians 2 9-12,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.960
 2 Thessalonians 3 6-12, and Philippians 4 10-20.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:24.000
 There is no shortage of Paulian passages that have some bearing on ministry finance.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.160
 At the same time, an initial look at Paul's ministry may cause us to level charges of

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.400
 inconsistency.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.280
 He commands people to give to ministers, yet rejects their attempts at payment.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.200
 Sometimes he even receives money from the same people he earlier refused.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:50.960
 Does he arbitrarily create rules the way in CIS arbitrarily creates fictional security threats?

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.800
 In this chapter, I want to take a look at the Corinthian epistles, where the apostle

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.840
 most directly sets forward his financial policy.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.920
 We will see that Paul is perfectly consistent, adopting the exact same pattern Jesus set for

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.760
 his disciples.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.360
 Rejection of reciprocity

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.440
 In 1 Corinthians 9 and 2 Corinthians 11, Paul explains that he refuses to preach for

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.160
 pay.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.620
 The list of a variety of reasons why he does this, but these reasons may not overturn the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.000
 simple "what" of his actions.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.280
 In both of these passages, the apostle provides a direct description of his policy, to preach

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.960
 the gospel free of charge.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.360
 What then is my reward that my preaching I may present the gospel free of charge, so it's

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.920
 not to make full use of my right in the gospel.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.000
 Is Corinthians 9/18?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.040
 Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted because I preach

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.280
 God's gospel to you free of charge?

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.200
 2 Corinthians 11/7

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.960
 Simply stated, Paul rejects reciprocity, all that is offered in direct exchange for

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.520
 his work of ministry.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.880
 Many assume that Paul refuses Corinthian funds out of a preservation of his own independence.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.240
 By accepting their money, he would implicitly grant them the status of patron, obligating

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.200
 himself to them.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.960
 However, as frequently as this motivation is assumed, Paul never intimates it.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.160
 Further, a host of problems prohibit this understanding, not the least of which is that

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.160
 Paul's epistles do not indicate that the Corinthians seek to have some status over

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.360
 Paul, but that they seek to have some status under him.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.280
 That is, if the patronage model should be applied, the Corinthians wish to be Paul's

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.680
 clients, not his patrons.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:04.040
 Instead, we must look elsewhere to elucidate the Apostles' rationale.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.320
 Reception of Propeppo Support

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:15.200
 Despite his commitments, the Apostle Paul does not reject financial support altogether,

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.280
 even in the context of his gospel preaching.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.680
 For example, in both Corinthian epistles, he speaks of his intentions to come to Corinth

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.080
 in order to be sent by them to Macedonia.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.640
 I will visit you after passing through Macedonia, for I intend to pass through Macedonia, and

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.720
 perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter so that you may help me on my journey,

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.520
 wherever I go, 1 Corinthians 16, 5, 3, 6.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.840
 I want it to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia, and

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.840
 have you send me on my way to Judea, 2 Corinthians 116.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:02.160
 The word for "help" and "send" in these verses is the Greek word "propeppo," a term with

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:08.640
 financial overtones, meaning "to assist someone in a journey, send on one's way with food,

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:14.520
 money, by arranging for companions, means of travel, etc.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:21.480
 For example, when Paul commands Titus to "propeppo" Zemus and Apollos, he is to do so, seeing

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.040
 that they lack nothing, Titus 313.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.720
 And each of these verses, Paul makes it clear that he intends to have the Corinthians

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.040
 support him in his missionary travels.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:41.120
 In 1 Corinthians 16, 6 through 7, the anticipation of an extended stay focuses on the Corinthians

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.160
 helping the Apostles rather than the Apostle ministering to them.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.640
 Additionally, rather than referring to the blessing of Paul's ministry, the second experience

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:57.560
 of grace in 2 Corinthians 115 likely refers to the Corinthians' opportunity to support

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.240
 the Apostle.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:05.240
 This fits with Paul's use of grace to refer to generosity and service.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:13.400
 1 Corinthians 163, 2 Corinthians 8.4, verses 6 through 7, verse 19.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.560
 Yet how does this anticipation of "propeppo" support fit with Paul's stated commitment

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.720
 to refuse any payment from the Corinthians?

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.560
 Propeppo as "co-labor."

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:32.680
 If Paul permanently refuses Corinthian support, yet also plans to accept it, there is an apparent

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.000
 contradiction.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.560
 However, we can resolve this discrepancy by recognizing that while Paul resolutely

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:45.800
 opposes the reciprocity of Corinthian payment, Propeppo support more naturally falls under

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.360
 the rubric of "co-labor."

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.480
 Consider some of the biblical uses of the term.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:09:00.080
 The Church of Antioch sent Propeppo'd Paul and Barnabas to the Jerusalem Council in order

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.280
 to deal with the threat of the Judeisers, Acts 153.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:11.680
 That is, the Antiochians co-labored with Paul and Barnabas to defend the Gospel.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:18.920
 Paul asks to be sent Propeppo'd to Spain by the Roman Church, Romans 1524, presumably

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.880
 for the purpose of evangelism.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:29.000
 In other words, he asks them to co-labor with him for the propagation of the Gospel.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.920
 Paul requests Propeppo's support for Timothy on the grounds that he is doing the work of the

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.360
 Lord as I end.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.160
 First Corinthians 16, 10-11.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:46.360
 The Corinthians are to assist or co-labor with Timothy in this work.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:51.680
 Paul likewise solicits Propeppo's support for Zenus and Apollos, while Zenus is otherwise

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.680
 unknown.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:59.360
 Apollos undoubtedly performs some ministerial work that Titus, and presumably his congregation,

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.340
 is able to help with by sending them on their way, Titus 313.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:10.600
 They are to co-labor with Zenus and Apollos to promote the teaching of the Gospel.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:16.840
 And perhaps the clearest instance of co-labor, John argues that guys should send down Propeppo,

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:23.560
 noble missionaries, that we may be fellow workers for the truth, their John 8.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.200
 So is Propeppo's support co-labor?

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.520
 plainly.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.240
 By sending Paul on his way, the Corinthians would assist him in proclaiming the Gospel in

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.480
 Macedonia or any other destination.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:40.480
 In fact, in the very same context, he calls himself a co-laborer.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.680
 Second Corinthians 124.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.600
 Paul does not reject all money, but only that which would constitute payment and compromise

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.000
 his free of charge proclamation of the Gospel.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.400
 Thus, Paul can say that he does not write to receive any such provision, i.e., reciprocity,

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:05.160
 and first Corinthians 915, while also writing to receive some provision as he is sent out

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:12.320
 on his way, i.e. co-labor, and first Corinthians 165-6.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.880
 Labour as suffering.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.840
 If the idea of treating money as co-labor seems odd, we should start by first looking at Paul's

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:25.120
 view of labour and how it relates to suffering.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.480
 Labour and suffering may seem like disparate concepts, but consider how frequently Paul

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:36.000
 lists toil among his many persecutions.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.960
 To the present hour, we hunger and thirst.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:45.320
 We are poorly dressed and buffeted and homeless, and we labour working with our own hands, first

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.000
 Corinthians 411-12.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.560
 But as servants of God, we commend ourselves in every way by great endurance and afflictions,

00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:03.080
 hardships, calamities, beatings, imprisonments, riots, labour, sleepless nights, hunger.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.520
 First Corinthians 6-4-5.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.600
 Are they servants of Christ?

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.040
 I am a better one.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:15.720
 I am talking like a madman, with far greater labour, far more imprisonments, with countless

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.880
 beatings, and often near death.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.520
 Five times I received at the hands of the Jews, the forty lashes less one.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.120
 Three times I was beaten with rods.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.080
 Once I was stoned.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.560
 Three times I was shipwrecked.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:35.760
 A night and a day I was adrift at sea on frequent journeys and danger from rivers, danger

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:42.120
 from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:49.200
 in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers, and toil and hardship.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.520
 Through many a sleepless night and hunger and thirst, often without food, and cold and

00:12:54.520 --> 00:13:00.880
 exposure, second Corinthians 1124-27.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.940
 Paul does not distinguish between manual labour and all the other forms of hardship he

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.860
 endures for the sake of the gospel.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:15.220
 In waving the financial returns of secular toil in order to fund his own ministry, he suffers.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:21.300
 This truth extends to all people, any who work, denying themselves the fruit of their labour,

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.100
 suffer.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.820
 Co-labor as shared suffering.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:30.940
 If labour is suffering, the ministerial co-labor is nothing more than shared suffering

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.500
 for the sake of the gospel.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:38.620
 This becomes apparent in Galatians, where Paul speaks of giving to ministers in the context

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.180
 of carrying each other's burdens.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.300
 Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:51.140
 Let the one who has taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.420
 Galatians 6-2 and 6.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:59.620
 Those who sacrificial give in order to spare Paul the task of secular employment, suffer

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:04.580
 hand in hand with him, carrying a portion of his burdens.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:11.740
 When one gives for the sake of the gospel, he experiences self-imposed hardship, e.g. financial

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:18.100
 loss, in order to bolster the efforts of another who voluntarily experiences hardship directly

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.340
 in the mission field.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:26.100
 As the book of Hebrews declares, "Do help one who is persecuted is to join in that experience

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.100
 of persecution," Hebrews 10:33.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:35.320
 "Those that give to the apostle do not simply labour with him, but in the employment of the

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.620
 same master."

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.660
 Paul continues to explain that one who gives to a minister ultimately gives to God.

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.140
 "Do not be deceived.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.500
 God is not mocked.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.780
 For whatever one soes, that will he also reap.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:54.300
 For the one who soes to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.780
 But the one who soes to the spirit will from the spirit reap eternal life."

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.180
 Galatians 6, 7-8.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:06.780
 Paul considers one who gives for the sake of the gospel to sow to the spirit.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:12.460
 That is, in the spiritual economy, the direct and ultimate obligation is to God rather

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:18.660
 than the minister.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:23.260
 Note that the spirit in this context refers to the Holy Spirit.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:28.660
 C.F., Galatians 5, 16-25.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:33.100
 Acts of giving in hospitality are co-labor in the fullest sense.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:38.620
 For a minister's needs to be met, either he or other believers must engage in some profit

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.660
 generating enterprise to fund his ministry.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:50.260
 Regardless of who performs the work, that secular labor supports the same spiritual ministry.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.060
 The blessing of shared suffering.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:58.820
 The Apostle Paul has no qualms with others experiencing this hardship for the sake of the gospel.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.940
 Because while they suffer together, they receive comfort together.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.780
 Our hope for you is unshaken.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:11.580
 For we know that as you share in our sufferings, you will also share in our comfort.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.620
 2 Corinthians 1-7.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:19.540
 On the other hand, reciprocity lacks any similar spiritual benefit.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.740
 Someone who gives out of a sense of duty to man does not experience suffering and service

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.940
 to God.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:33.100
 This explains how Paul can simultaneously refuse and receive support in different contexts.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:39.740
 Furthermore, it explains how he can simultaneously reject funds and command his churches to support

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.580
 the work of ministry.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.380
 C.F., 1 Corinthians 9-14.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.900
 Galatians 6-6.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:52.220
 By declining payment, he does not prevent anyone from fulfilling their obligation to give,

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:58.500
 but frees them to do so rightly in order that they might truly bless.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.980
 Conclusion.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.860
 Do you see the connection to our discoveries in the previous chapter?

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:08.620
 Paul's policy follows the command of Christ.

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:15.460
 And refusing ministerial reciprocity while accepting and encouraging ministerial collabor,

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:20.540
 Paul does precisely what Jesus commanded of his disciples.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:26.580
 In fact, both Jesus and Paul use the same Greek word "dorian" to describe their ministry

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.980
 as being free of charge.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.140
 2 Corinthians 11-7.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:35.260
 Matthew 10-8.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:39.980
 While initially perplexing, Paul's behavior is perfectly consistent.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:45.420
 His fidelity to the Dorian Principle leads him to reject direct payment for the gospel,

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.500
 yet otherwise accept assistance.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:55.460
 Duty to God must triumph over a sensed debt to any minister, since God mediates all obligation

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.700
 to his servants as ministers.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:03.820
 And the next chapter, we will consider the nature and shape of this mediated obligation

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:09.060
 as we continue to examine 1 Corinthians 9.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.060
 End of chapter 2.
