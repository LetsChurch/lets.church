00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 The Dorian Principle, a biblical response to the commercialization of Christianity by

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.320
 Conley Owens, Appendix C, Copyright and Natural Law.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.080
 In Chapter 13, I argued that the Dorian Principle should lead ministers to forego legal enforcement

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.800
 of copyright protections in the context of ministry.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.240
 However, there is a stronger case to be made that all Christians should waive such protections

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.720
 in all contexts.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.240
 While theologians differ on the matter, I would argue that a biblical view of natural

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.040
 law delegitimizes the entire notion of intellectual property.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.360
 First, it should be recognized that copyright laws and artificial imposition on the economy

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.880
 of creative works, and the words of Christopher May and Susan K. Celle, intellectual property

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.080
 constructs a scarce resource from knowledge or information that is not formally scarce.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.920
 Ideas are inherently reproducible, and in an additional age, the cost of reproducing

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.960
 most works is negligible.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.960
 However, copyright protection maintains an economy around the selling and buying of

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.840
 licenses to obtain copies of creative works and the rights to use them.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.600
 Beyond this initial observation, the relatively recent advent of copyright regulations demonstrates

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.000
 their nature as purely human inventions.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.280
 If they were instead codifications of a divine principle, one would expect such statutes

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.320
 to appear earlier in human history.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.040
 Additionally, while most relevant laws protect material property to perpetuity, the copyright

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.360
 protection offered by governments is, in all but a few circumstances, temporary.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.880
 This constitutes an implicit concession that intellectual property is not property in

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.040
 the truest sense.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.960
 The fact that some of these protections last for 20 years and some longer than a lifetime

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.680
 testified to the arbitrary nature of intellectual property law.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.600
 Of course, not all would agree.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.480
 Some have argued that copyright protection stems from natural rights, those rights given

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.880
 by God.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.840
 In fact, the founding fathers of the United States incorporated provision for intellectual

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.680
 property law and the Constitution on the basis of a lock-yam understanding of natural

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.240
 rights.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.040
 If one has a right to liberty and property, the body being irrevocably the property of

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.800
 the individual, then he has a right to the products of his body, the fruit of his labors.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.840
 Moreover, one who goes about the improvement of nature ought to be able to reap the rewards

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.880
 of that improvement.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.800
 Following this line of reasoning, one may conclude that no categorical difference exists between

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.280
 intellectual property and material property.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.760
 One who fashions a creative work ought to have ownership over it as his own property.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.200
 While these lock-yam premises are unobjectionable, the conclusion must be questioned.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.800
 To protect the product of the mind is not the right to hold a secret sufficient.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.520
 One who is not compelled to divulge information or share property may keep his creative works

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.840
 to himself.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.240
 However, once disseminated, he has freely given this information to the public.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.880
 With material property, a violation of the eighth commandment, they shall not steal, results

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.680
 in direct loss for another individual.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.960
 With intellectual property, undesired copying and use of a published work may only be counted

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.920
 as a loss when estimating the potential of an idea to garner profit.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.480
 In the words of Thomas Jefferson, "If nature has made any one thing less susceptible

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.560
 than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.000
 an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself."

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.560
 But the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of everyone, and the

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.000
 receiver cannot dispossess himself of it.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.400
 Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less because every other possesses

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.080
 the whole of it.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.320
 He who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself without lessening mind, as he who

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.000
 lights his taper at mind, receives light without darkening me.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.440
 That idea should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.880
 mutual instruction of man and improvement of his condition seems to have been peculiarly

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.120
 and benevolently designed by nature when she made them like fire, expandable over all

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.160
 space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:55.200
 move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.880
 In my estimation, the language employed in copyright legislation betrays the underlying

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.280
 utilitarian motives.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.240
 The US Constitution gives Congress the power to promote the progress of science and useful

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.960
 arts by securing for limited times to authors and investors the exclusive right to their respected

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.880
 writings and discoveries.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.340
 The statute of an established copyright law for preventing the detriment of authors and

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.440
 proprietors for the future and for the encouragement of learned men to compose and write useful

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.920
 books.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.840
 Rather than flowing from natural rights endowed by our creator, copyright law arises from

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.040
 a pragmatic desire to model the economy of creative works after the economy of physical

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.600
 goods.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.440
 If it can be granted that the government has a sweeping authority to wield its power to

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.120
 improve the lives of its subjects, modern copyright may have some place in society.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.720
 If instead the God-ordained authority of the civil magistrate is limited to the enforcement

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.880
 of retributive justice, the government may only prosecute those who have violated the natural

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.840
 rights of another.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:10.560
 In this view, Lex Talley-Hannes, Exist 2124, combined with the Deuteronomic principle

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:17.200
 that justice shall not be perverted by other paragogatives due to the Deuteronomy 1617-20,

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.240
 restricts governing authorities from erecting legislation extraneous to the violation of

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.640
 one's property rights.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.280
 If copyright is not a natural right, then its protection is not a legitimate function of

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.560
 government.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:37.000
 If copyright is not a natural right, then it is unethical for any man or ministry to use

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.360
 the power of government in a court of law to enforce copyright.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.840
 In fact, rather than a protection of the copyright holders' rights, such an action would be a violation

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:54.120
 of the consumer's rights, as they ought to be able to do as they please with the information

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.760
 in their possession.
