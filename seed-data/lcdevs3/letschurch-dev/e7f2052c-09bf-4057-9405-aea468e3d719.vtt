00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160
 The Dorian Principle, a biblical response to the commercialization of Christianity by

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.040
 Conley Owens.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.280
 CHAPTER VI.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.760
 The Sincereity of Ministry.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.800
 Pragmatism versus Principle.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.680
 I did not have a lasting career in the world of theater, but I did enjoy the time I spent

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.160
 in it.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.520
 At one point, I had the privilege of being cast in a community production of the Fantastics.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.000
 If you were unfamiliar with the musical, the first act models the plot of Romeo and Juliet,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.320
 but ends more comically than the Shakespearean tragedy.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.280
 Two young lovers pursue each other while their feuding families attempt to keep them apart.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.080
 Through their perseverance, they happily marry by the end of the first act.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.640
 However, the couple struggles to keep their relationship together in the second act

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.360
 when they discovered the family conflict was all a ruse.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.800
 Their fathers only pretended to fight in order to match make the rebellious use.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.800
 Who they were certain would do exactly what they told them not to do and fall in love

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.320
 with exactly whom they told them not to fall in love with.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.360
 The word "prigmatic" best describes the two fathers in the Fantastics.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.840
 While other parents might be driven by principles such as honesty or liberty, these fathers

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.400
 were dead set on accomplishing the match through whatever means they had available to them.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.440
 This divide between pragmatism and principle applies to our consideration of Paul's ministry.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.800
 Most people would not regard the Apostle Paul as a devious manipulator.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.480
 Regardless, many label his refusal of funds as an act of pragmatism, an otherwise morally

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:56.120
 neutral course of action taken in order to advance the gospel with minimal impediment.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.040
 Sometimes Paul refuses funds in order to promote an industrious work ethic.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.560
 Sometimes he refuses funds in order to satisfy the expectations of his audience.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.360
 Sometimes he refuses funds in order to accommodate the impoverished.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.480
 Sometimes he refuses funds in order to avoid conflicts of interest and so on.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.120
 And the course of this book, I have taken a different approach, rejecting the notion that

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.160
 Paul primarily acts out of various pragmatic motivations.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.600
 Rather, I have identified the Apostle as a principled actor following a singular moral code

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.240
 set by Christ.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.840
 Yet, this code itself is not without its own underlying motivation.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.040
 Paul does not promote obedience to an arbitrary rule, but instead highlights the virtue that

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.200
 undergirds the Dorian principle and its rejection of reciprocity.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.800
 While he indeed speaks of gospel reach and other motivations, he primarily emphasizes

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.160
 the importance of sincerity.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.880
 He states the matter most directly in his second epistle to the Corinthians.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.920
 For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God's word, but as men of sincerity as commissioned

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.640
 by God and the sight of God, we speak in Christ, 2 Corinthians 217.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.560
 Paul identifies the peddling of God's word, i.e. receiving an exchange for ministry as

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.360
 the opposite of sincerity.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.280
 While the Apostle occasionally mentions other factors that motivate his policy, this goal

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.640
 sits at the core of his intentions.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.040
 In this chapter, we will explore a handful of Paul's stated motivations examining how

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.440
 they align with the virtue of sincerity.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.720
 These motivations certainly voice Paul's concern for the spread of the gospel, but ultimately

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.200
 clear his name from charges of pragmatism.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.960
 More importantly, they reveal sincerity's discord with reciprocity, as well as its

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.120
 harmony with co-labor.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.560
 Sincere ministry.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.240
 In the previous chapter, we saw that Paul waives his right to support in order to maintain

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.200
 his status as a servant.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.760
 He naturally follows that he must abide by the Dorean principle in order to serve sincerely.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.480
 While he primarily speaks of his service to the Lord in 1 Corinthians 9, he also speaks

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.560
 of his service to others, 1 Corinthians 9-19.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.080
 This continues in 2 Corinthians 11, where the Apostle claims that he preaches free of charge

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.240
 in order to exalt others.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.440
 Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted?

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:44.280
 As I preach God's gospel to you free of charge, 2 Corinthians 117.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.080
 While Paul's humility is physical, the Corinthians' exaltation is spiritual.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.000
 That is, the Apostle exalts the Corinthians through their salvation.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.520
 They have been raised up and seated in the heavenly places, Ephesians 2 6.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:06.280
 The preceding context redefines this exaltation in terms of the truth of Christ, 2 Corinthians

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.280
 2.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.000
 If his goal is the salvation of the Corinthians, then Paul rejects funds in order that he

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.800
 can rightly or effectively preach the gospel.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.520
 On either of these counts, Paul's free preaching extends from his sincerity.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.600
 If it is necessary to preach freely in order to preach rightly, he will do so because

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.960
 he minister sincerely without ulterior motive.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.920
 If it is necessary to preach freely in order to preach effectively, he will do so because

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.960
 he sincerely desires the Corinthian exaltation.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.960
 Paul argues that his rejection of payment is an expression of love for the Corinthians.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.040
 2 Corinthians 11 11.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.200
 CF Galatians 4 16.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.600
 Anything else would be insincere.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.760
 CF 2 Corinthians 2 17.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.520
 Not truly a pursuit of love.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.520
 Insir Apostleship

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.840
 As Paul's ministry is in his apostleship, it stands to reason that sincere ministry demands

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.640
 sincere apostleship.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:21.000
 Thus, when false apostles began leading people astray in Corinth, Paul appeals to his fidelity

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.600
 to the Dorian Principle and in order to demonstrate the truth of his apostleship.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.680
 As his opponents have not lived up to the same standard, this same principle demonstrates

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.480
 their false apostleship.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.720
 Speaking of his rejection of funds, Paul writes, "And what I am doing, I will continue to

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.720
 do, and in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that in their

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.200
 boasted mission, they work on the same terms as we do."

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.720
 2 Corinthians 11 12.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.840
 Paul chooses rejection of payment as a marker of delineation between himself and others who

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.320
 claim to have a similar apostolic ministry, and his choice of this particular distinctive

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.040
 is not arbitrary.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:12.640
 If his actions are to cut off opportunity from his opponents to claim apostolicity, what

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:19.120
 he does must actually mark his ministry as true, not merely different.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:25.760
 As the Greek word Apostolos indicates, an apostle is sent, and this commission entails a certain

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.840
 behavior toward those to whom he is sent.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:35.040
 He must share his message indiscriminately, and without return from the recipients of his

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:41.800
 message, not adopting the commercial practices of one who has ulterior motives.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.960
 This practice and attitude distinguish Paul from his opponents in 2 Corinthians.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:55.440
 With this contrast in mind, he pins the following words, "For we are not like so many, peddlers

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.880
 of God's word," 2 Corinthians 2 17a.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.200
 Sincere parenthood

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.920
 Later in 2 Corinthians, Paul speaks of his spiritual fatherhood.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:13.760
 Here for the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden, for I seek

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.280
 not what is yours, but you.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:22.040
 For children are not obligated to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:30.600
 In 2 Corinthians 12 14, C.F. 1st S. 2 5 through 7, 9 through 12.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.920
 This language of paternity highlights Paul's role in the conversion of the Corinthians.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:41.640
 Thus, he says that he became a father to the Corinthians in the Gospel.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.920
 1 Corinthians 4 15.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:50.320
 Similarly, he birthed his Galatian children through the formation of Christ within them.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:56.000
 In 2 Corinthians 4 19, and he became a Necimus's father upon a Necimus's conversion,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.520
 Faleemon 10 through 11.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:04.240
 This metaphor of paternity provides an illustration of why it would be particularly inappropriate

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:09.560
 for Paul to engage in ministerial reciprocity with his church plans.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.360
 While others might receive payment from their converts, Paul declines because this would

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.680
 be akin to a father burdening his child.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.400
 He rejects their money out of love, 2 Corinthians 11 and 11.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:28.560
 He repeats this paternal ethic to the Thessalonians, contrasting greed and parenthood.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:34.120
 As their spiritual father, Paul must act sincerely as a parent, rather than with the pretext

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.000
 for greed.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.360
 For we never came with words of flattery, as you know, nor with the pretext for greed,

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:47.040
 God is witness, nor did we seek glory from people, whether from you or from others,

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.760
 that we could have made demands as an apostle of Christ.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:56.040
 But we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother taking care of her own children,

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.360
 first Thessalonians 2, 5 through 7.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:05.840
 Yet, in a sense, Paul does demand a form of repayment for his fatherly love.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:12.840
 In return, I speak as to children, widen your hearts also, 2 Corinthians 6, 13.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:18.000
 While the apostle does not burden his children by accepting payment from his ministry, he demands

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.240
 the repayment of love and honor.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:27.600
 In context, they are to do this by receiving his appeal to be reconciled to God, 2 Corinthians

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.400
 5-20.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:34.520
 In other words, sincere parenthood warrants sincere child-like difference.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.640
 If Paul desires to secure the cooperation of his converts, he must reject their payment

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.560
 as a loving father.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.960
 In sincere diligence.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:50.720
 In Thessalonica, Paul refuses funds in order to set an example of hard work.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.200
 For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not idle when we were

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.440
 with you.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.480
 Nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with toil and labor we worked night

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.400
 and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.200
 It was not because we do not have that right, but to give you in ourselves an example to

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:15.280
 imitate 2 Thessalonians 3, 7, 3, 9.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.800
 Some have taken these comments to mean that though Paul has no obligation to engage in manual

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.160
 labor, he does so in order to offer a lesson on work ethic.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:31.200
 However, if preaching and teaching are labors worthy of reward, see at 1 Timothy 5-17, why are

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.520
 they not sufficient examples for the Thessalonians?

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.000
 Since Paul could undoubtedly work diligently as an apostle while refraining from physical

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.760
 labor, there must be some illegitimate see in accepting payment for his ministry.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.000
 Indeed, there is.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 The proceeding epistle to the Thessalonians clarifies the matter, contrasting a pretext

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.360
 for greed for Thessalonians 2.5 with Paul's statement that we worked night and day for

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.600
 Thessalonians 2.9, CF 2 Thessalonians 3.8.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:08.080
 To receive payment from converts would be greedy and therefore lazy.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.440
 Prior to the diligence required of God's servants, sincere diligence demands for going

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.440
 ministerial reciprocity.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:21.280
 Paul's ethic appears again as examples in his parting message to Ephesus.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.480
 I coveted no one's silver or gold or a peril.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:29.160
 You yourselves know that these hands minister to my necessities and to those who were with

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.160
 me.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:35.080
 And all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way, we must help the weak and

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:40.560
 remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, "It is more blessed to give

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.000
 than to receive."

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.040
 Acts 20, 33-35.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:52.400
 The apostle pits manual labor ministering to his own needs against covetousness.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:59.040
 In other words, sincere diligence in the work of ministry requires the rejection of unmediated

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.680
 payment.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.360
 He identifies anything else as greed.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.680
 Furthermore, he must help the weak by ministering freely.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.520
 To minister for pay would not be sufficient.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.660
 By rejecting support in context where it would constitute direct payment, Paul sets an

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.680
 example of hard work.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:25.040
 However, this example is not grounded in arbitrary illustrative toil, but in the sincere

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.120
 diligence required by the Doreen Principle.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.960
 Sincere partnership.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:37.400
 Finally, returning to 1 Corinthians 9, Paul selectively refuses financial support so

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.600
 that he may be a partner in the work of the gospel.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.760
 He gives priority to this motivation when he chooses to summarize his concerns with

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:51.080
 the following words, "I do all things for the sake of the gospel, so that I may become

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.120
 a fellow partaker of it."

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.200
 1 Corinthians 9-23, NASB.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:03.360
 The Greek word for fellow partaker here derives from Coenania, the word used to refer to partnership

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.360
 in Philippians.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.280
 In this verse, many translations speak of the gospel and sharing in its blessings.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:15.880
 However, this elaboration shifts the focus from the proclamation of the gospel to the rewards

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:20.680
 of the gospel and potentially misses the point of Paul's argument.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.720
 Having stated his sincere desire for the salvation of others, he does not suddenly reveal that

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:31.320
 he is primarily concerned for his own salvation or that he hopes to benefit as his converts

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.320
 do.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.680
 Here, and in the following context, he speaks of sharing in the gospel as a minister of

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:44.640
 it, describing himself as an athlete striving for a reward in verses 24-27.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:50.640
 Paul does not imagine himself mariting the gift of salvation, but winning the special prize

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.840
 due to faithful ministers.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.640
 See, 1 Corinthians 3-14.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:03.440
 In 1 Corinthians 9-23, it is best to see Paul as sharing in the work of the gospel.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.600
 The preceding context confirms this.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:12.000
 The apostle has explained that causing another to stumble is to oppose the gospel, but

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.320
 here he offers the alternative.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.320
 To lead one to salvation is to be its partner.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:22.800
 Furthermore, this use of the word gospel without an attendant verb frequently indicates

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:31.960
 the proclamation of the gospel, Romans 1-1, 1 Corinthians 9-14, 2 Corinthians 2-12, 10-14,

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:37.520
 Galatians 2-7, Philippians 2-22, 4-15.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:42.960
 And the words of one pair of commentators, Paul's overriding allegiance is as a partner

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.360
 of the gospel.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.480
 On many occasions, Paul rejects financial support so that he might sincerely partner in the

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.480
 work of ministry.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.120
 Other times, his reception of funds does not compromise that goal.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:03.400
 On those occasions, those who support him are his partners, CF Philippians 4-15.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:09.600
 Evidenceing the notion of co-labor, this passage reveals Paul's motivation of sincerity.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.720
 Rather than only putting on the appearance of a fellow worker, he selectively accepts

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:19.640
 support so he might engage in sincere partnership.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.640
 Conclusion

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:26.720
 Notions of earnestness and veracity resound behind all of Paul's explicit motivations for

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.960
 rejecting payment.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:35.160
 The apostle operates as a sincere servant, a sincere apostle, a sincere father, and a sincere

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.840
 partner.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:42.040
 To wholeheartedly do what he has been called to do and genuinely be what he has been called

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:47.600
 to be, he must reject ministerial reciprocity.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:53.840
 He propels the Dorian principle, that is, "Dorian ministry is sincere ministry."

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.840
 In the next chapter, we will see that the Bible identifies all non-Dorian ministry as

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:28.400
 insincere, the work of false teachers, and of chapter 6.
