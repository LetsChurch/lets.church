00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
 The Dorian Principle, a biblical response to the commercialization of Christianity by

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.040
 Conle Owens, chapter 14, the path of progress.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.440
 Problem vs. solution.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.320
 A friend of mine named Brian runs a website that displays images of ancient New Testament

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.160
 manuscripts.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.120
 One day he received an email from a museum demanding he pay $100 or take down his image

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:38.840
 of P66, a fragment of John generally regarded as the oldest surviving New Testament manuscript.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.200
 The museum possessed this particular relic, and then sending the message to Brian, claimed

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.080
 that they owned the copyright to the photographic copy featured on his site.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.000
 It's not merely hobbyist activities that are stung by such approaches to copyright.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.880
 For example, it has even had an impact on the Center for the Study of New Testament

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.480
 Manuscripts, CSNTM, the foremost institution in the digitization and archival of New Testament

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.520
 manuscripts.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.160
 At a presentation from its Executive Director, Daniel B. Wallace, I once asked why so many

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:20.200
 of the organization's archived digitizations were inaccessible through the CSNTM website.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.840
 Dr. Wallace responded by appealing to copyright and contractual agreements with the institutions

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.720
 that own the physical manuscripts.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.160
 The notion that copyright protects mechanical reproductions of public domain works is dubious

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.680
 at best, and substantial court precedent indicates otherwise.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.200
 Regardless, in either of these examples, we see that the spirit Athenian continues today.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.520
 The sixth century dispute over a copied salter has resurfaced in our own digital era.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.400
 But as discussed in the preceding chapter, this issue goes far beyond Manuscripts' scripture.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.160
 All ministry must conform to the Dorian Principle.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.240
 In this final chapter, I'd like to begin with the production of Bible versions and continue

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.120
 on to address a few other areas where I believe the biblical ethic of ministry fundraising has

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.080
 been compromised.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.520
 At each stop, I'd also like to offer some steps the church may take to restore that ethic.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.520
 Bibles

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.200
 A surprising number of restrictions limit the distribution and use of scripture.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.080
 To begin, the ancient handwritten manuscripts that preserve our old and new testaments are

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.000
 largely inaccessible to the public.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.920
 Many of these manuscripts hide behind physical walls because they have not been digitized,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.560
 but others hide behind paywalls designed to direct revenue toward museums and other institutions.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.880
 Because manuscripts each have their own scribal peculiarities, prior to translation, Bible

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.360
 societies typically rescind these collected writings into a single document, known as a critical

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.760
 addition.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.880
 While legal ambiguity clouds the matter, courts outside the United States have upheld

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.440
 copyright protection for critical editions.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.120
 Likewise, copyright protection applies to translations of scripture.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.680
 Fair use doctrine dictates that creative works may reproduce portions of other creative

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.080
 works for certain purposes and to limited degrees.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.600
 But at least in the United States, no law can concretely codify these limits.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.080
 Due to this ambiguity, Bible version copyright holders typically provide their own guidelines,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.800
 offering consumers some guarantee on what usage they will not litigate.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.200
 Almost all English versions of the Bible offer roughly the same guidelines for works that

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.880
 incorporate them.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.200
 1.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.640
 The work must not be sold or used commercially.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.520
 Note that the notion of commercial use typically includes practices such as featuring

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.280
 verses on the website that displays ads to gain revenue.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.800
 2.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.880
 No more than 500 verses may be reproduced.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.880
 3.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.440
 No book of the Bible may be reproduced in its entirety.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.440
 4.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.920
 The reproduced text may not compose more than 25% of the work that contains it.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.920
 5.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.640
 The reproduced text may not be modified from the original text of the version.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.040
 6.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.240
 The version must be cited.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.240
 A.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.720
 Non-cell will mean that such as church bulletins may simply use the appropriate version acronym,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.880
 EG and IV.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.000
 2.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Sailable medium lists include a full copyright notice.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Typically this is roughly 25 words long.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.360
 Note that items such as bookmarks, t-shirts, etc. are considered saleable, even if they

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.960
 are not sold.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.720
 As just one example, the King James Version of the Bible, KJV, is governed by most of these

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.560
 standard guidelines.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.340
 Contrary to popular belief, the KJV does not exist in the public domain, but is actually

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.940
 protected by the crown's perpetual copyright, although none have attempted to enforce these

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.140
 restrictions outside of the United Kingdom.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.820
 Of course, public domain translations do exist, but these represent only a small minority

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.560
 of those in circulation.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.120
 Any restriction on the distribution and use of the Bible potentially harms the church.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.400
 It is not merely that ministries may be inhibited from printing and distributing Bibles, but that

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.800
 all sorts of uses of the Bible are unduly uncombert.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.160
 To publish a track with heavy Bible usage typically requires special authorization.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.920
 To fashion multi-version Bible reading software comparable to the popular options that currently

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.240
 exist, developers must secure rights from dozens of institutions.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.120
 Other potential applications share a similar overhead.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.120
 Moreover, for those confused or discouraged by the proliferation of Bible versions, it

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:06.160
 is worth noting this undoubtedly exists in part because of restrictions imposed by copyright.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.400
 Rather than pay out to other publishing houses, each publishing house with sufficient resources

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.920
 fashions its own version that it may use royalty-free.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:24.160
 Beyond these pragmatic concerns, we must ask whether a biblical principle has been violated.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.880
 If the local church must minister without reciprocity, then it must have the capacity to offer the

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.440
 Bible without restriction.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.600
 If Jesus demanded the gospel be proclaimed freely, then the gospel as recorded by His

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.840
 apostles should be offered without cost.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.520
 Granted, the various institutions that collect manuscripts, create critical editions, and

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.280
 produce translations may operate only as academic enterprises having no interest in sincere

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.760
 ministry.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:59.360
 However, many of these institutions publicly state their intent to further the gospel, and

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.120
 inasmuch as they aim to advance the kingdom of God, they violate the Dory principle when

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.400
 they employ copyright protections to restrict the use of the Bible.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.400
 Books

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.600
 While Bibles remain fundamental to Christian or religious instruction, other books are perhaps

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.400
 more germane to our investigation.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:25.200
 That is, as we have noted, one may archive biblical manuscripts, engage in textual criticism,

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.720
 and translate the Bible without any interest in the edification of the church.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.880
 However, apart from purely academic studies, other biblical resources are almost always

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.520
 created with the express intent of edifying the church or reaching the lost.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.480
 As such, the Dory principle especially regulates them.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:52.480
 Black details on Christian publishing are difficult to come by, but in 2015, Nielsen reported that

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:59.520
 adult nonfiction Christian book sales had top 30 million units sold in 2014, rising steadily

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.720
 from 18 million units in 2009.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:10.520
 Even with a conservative estimate, that represents hundreds of millions of dollars a year in sales.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:16.440
 With such large numbers, we should be concerned about the ethical implications for this industry.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:22.640
 If one sells a religious book at a price above the cost of printing, he exchanges teaching

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.680
 for fee.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.840
 Rather than follow the commercial publishing model of the world, ministers, i.e. Christian

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.600
 author's penning religious instruction, ought to give without pay because they have received

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.320
 without pay, CF Matthew 108.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:44.480
 Moreover, they ought not place any restriction on those who receive their teaching.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:49.280
 While most popular publishers require contractual agreements that would prohibit offering books

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.600
 freely, the present era has witnessed the rise of self-publishing.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.560
 Self-publishing comes with its own drawbacks and challenges, but churches should make use

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.600
 of such tools if they are necessary to conform to a biblical ethic of ministry fundraising.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:11.160
 Similarly, academic theological publications frequently require copyright reassignment,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:17.240
 so that institutions make control access to research and to maintain streams of revenue.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.800
 While the presence of open access publications have grown in some academic communities, these

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.080
 offerings lag behind in theological disciplines.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:33.000
 Established journals have cultivated communities in academic integrity, but certainly new institutions

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.640
 could do the same.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.040
 In the meantime, Christians who want to pursue this ethic will have to pursue publishing

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.640
 in less highly regarded journals or through alternative channels.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:50.280
 It bears repeating the insufficiency of offering such literature without financial cost.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.120
 Non-financial restrictions also transgress the Dorian principle.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:59.880
 For example, a book that is offered without a fee, but not licensed for modification, leaves

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.480
 distributors unable to adapt the book to their needs.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:10.680
 Some digital outlets might have different ways of packaging, encoding, or tagging documents,

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.720
 and these may be encumbered by copyright law apart from an explicit waiver.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.360
 Author seeking to minister freely should not inhibit any creative uses of their work.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.720
 The most substantial barrier to improvement in this area is that of establishment.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.600
 The Christian publishing industry offers a standard, time-tested method for distributing

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.200
 works and recovering incurred costs.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:40.920
 Moreover, as nearly all respectable authors of the last century have followed suit, this

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.280
 method has the tacit imprimatur of a host of saints.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:51.040
 However, any who wishes sincerely on our God must not confuse a generational homogeneity

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.080
 with reasoned judgment.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:11:00.040
 The sacred work of ministry must be distinguished from any sacred cow of method.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:06.960
 Hems in worship songs, while sung to the Lord, are also written for the instructional benefit

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.480
 of men.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.240
 As such, the Dorian principle must govern them.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.480
 At the moment, interested parties heavily regulate Christian worship music.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.760
 Many hymn lyrics are in the public domain, but typical publications of these Hems offer

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.800
 updated renditions subject to copyright protection.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.960
 The same phenomenon occurs when published arrangements pair ancient lyrics with modern

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.920
 tunes.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.160
 Performance of a musical work of a religious nature in the course of a service in a religious

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:44.720
 assembly does not constitute copyright infringement in the United States, but most jurisdictions

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:50.920
 forbid reproduction or other public performance of these Hems without express permission.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:56.240
 Frequently, the purchase of a hymnal grants a limited license for those activities.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:02.120
 For churches who singing repertoire exceeds traditional hymnity, Christian copyright licensing

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:08.120
 international CCLI manages the rights to the largest brunt of Christian worship music

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.560
 and issues licenses to churches and other entities.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:18.280
 However, even using these avenues to secure the necessary rights for congregational worship,

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.920
 one might be surprised at how many restrictions remain.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:27.000
 For example, many hymnals just allow print rate production of any kind.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.800
 Additionally, licenses rarely give broad rights to record music.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.400
 Furthermore, they typically prohibit changes to the musical arrangement.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:42.720
 For example, the CCLI does not give rights to alter or change the lyrics' melody or fundamental

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.640
 character of any song.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:51.000
 While many violate these terms in ignorance and suffer no consequences, copyright holders

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.920
 have prosecuted such cases against churches in court, even to the tune of millions of

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:03.240
 dollars in damages, and even for activities as seemingly innocuous as arranging a hymn

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.280
 for a choir.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.600
 While churches could simply restrict their musical worship to songs and tunes that exist

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:16.520
 in the public domain, many regard familiarity as essential to congregational singing and

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.480
 would not consider such limitations a viable option.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.560
 Additionally, at least in the United States, churches could rely on their provisions for

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.200
 religious assemblies which exempt them from the typical restrictions of the law.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:35.560
 However, in order to remain legally compliant, they would have to be circumspect regarding

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:42.360
 the music they copy and the context in which they sing protected worship songs.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:47.160
 For the song author, the apparent solution follows those previously given.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:52.760
 A public domain dedication removes any concerns about copyright protection, and in general,

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.160
 the copyright holders should not seek to take advantage of his legal protection.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.640
 To use the power of the civil government to enforce copyright protection on religious

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:07.240
 music is to fundamentally impose a worship tax on churches.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.240
 Software

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:15.040
 Insofar as software marries itself to gospel ministry, the Dorian principle must govern

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.760
 it as well.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.920
 In some cases, this is more easily discerned than others.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:27.160
 Bible study software, since it exists solely for the purpose of religious education, ought

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.520
 to conform to our stated ethic.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.800
 Of course, there are many applications that do not.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.720
 For example, the Bible study software logus does not include all features with anything

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:47.720
 lower than the gold package, which currently retails for $1,549.99.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:52.800
 On one hand, the landscape has changed so that it has become standard for the base versions

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.280
 of software packages to be offered at no cost.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:01.720
 On the other hand, these software producers often make money by upselling digital packages

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:06.800
 of licensed material, specifically tailored for their application.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.680
 Some public domain works retail at substantial prices.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.840
 As just one example, logus has set the list price for their edition of John Calvin's Institutes

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:22.040
 of the Christian Religion at $69.99.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.680
 Other tools do not specifically exist for the sake of religious instruction, but still

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.240
 attempt to provide assistance in the Christian life.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.240
 Mobile app prayer companions help Christians keep track of prayer requests.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:40.520
 Relief software helps Christians resist temptation on the internet, and church management systems

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.160
 help churches to keep track of their resources.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.240
 While the development of such applications may not be an activity that proclaims the

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:53.600
 gospel or directly attends to its proclamation, Christians should think twice before charging

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.960
 for such tools.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:01.200
 Recall that the disciples were forbidden from charging for healing, Matthew 10/8, and many

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.760
 of those tools aim to affect a sort of healing in the life of the user that they might better

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.840
 know the grace of Christ.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:14.800
 Anything governed by the Dorian principle should be offered freely without restriction.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:20.960
 In the context of software, this not only implies access to an application, but the permission

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.280
 to modify it.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:28.000
 Developers to designing applications and attempt to further the gospel should take this into

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.440
 account and write such adaptable software typically styled open source.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.520
 Conclusion

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.360
 In the modern age, copyright presents the greatest threat to the Dorian principle.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.640
 However, there is hope.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.600
 We do not have to be stuck in the age of Column-Cole and is fettered-sulter.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:54.720
 In each of the categories presented in this chapter, the church has the opportunity to move

00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:01.000
 forward by embracing support models that revolve around co-labor and abandon attempts to secure

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.400
 reciprocity.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.480
 End of chapter 14

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.480
 End of chapter 14
