00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760
 The Dorian Principle, a biblical response to the commercialization of Christianity by

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.240
 Conley Owens.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.760
 Chapter 8 The Apostles of Corinth, Partiality vs. Equity

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.560
 Are you familiar with the riddle of the Green Glass Door?

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.520
 It goes something like this.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.240
 I announced that there is a Green Glass Door and that only certain things can go through

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.520
 the Green Glass Door.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.400
 For example, I can bring a kitten, but no cat.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.280
 I can bring the moon, but not the sun.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.120
 I can bring a wheel, but not a tire.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.080
 The puzzle challenges others to figure out what kinds of things may be brought through

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.080
 the Green Glass Door.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.200
 They get an object, and I tell them whether or not it can go through the door.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.440
 When first encountering this riddle, you might think you see some pattern.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.240
 For example, the way I have set this up, you might be inclined to think that the Green

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.320
 Glass Door favors objects in miniature.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.040
 In fact, I would agree with you that I can bring something small through the door, but

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.800
 not something large.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.080
 However, you will likely be frustrated as you test this and find that you can bring

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.920
 a gorilla through the door, but not a chimp.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.360
 Eventually, someone in the group will discover the objects themselves don't matter at all.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.080
 Only they're spelling.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.960
 Words with double letters are permitted through, while words without double letters are not.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.080
 That's why it's called the Green Glass Door.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.320
 Similarly, if we only examine prominent features of the transactions he condones, Paul's

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.920
 financial policy may appear to operate by some arbitrary partiality.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.520
 Perhaps he favors true ministers, or perhaps he favors mature churches.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:02.560
 However, beyond these red herrings lies his true objective, the Dorian Principle.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.560
 In chapters 2 and 4, we used the Dorian Principle to resolve two apparent discrepancies in Paul's

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.440
 financial policy.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.600
 One, why does Paul reject Corinthian money, yet accept Corinthian propempo support?

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:24.600
 Two, why does Paul reject Corinthian and Thessalonian money, yet accept Philippian money?

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.400
 We saw that Paul rejected Corinthian funds because such would constitute reciprocity,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.760
 but he was willing to accept Corinthian propempo support because it would constitute

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.720
 co-labor.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.600
 Similarly, Paul rejected money from the Thessalonian church since it would only serve

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.440
 as repayment for the gospel, but he was willing to accept money from the Philippians

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.800
 because they contributed to Paul's resources in an act of co-labor.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.360
 In this chapter, we will use the Dorian Principle to clear up two additional litigmas.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.480
 Three, why does Paul reject Corinthian money, yet permits other apostles to receive it?

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.520
 Four, why does Paul condone the reception of Corinthian money by other apostles, yet condemn

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.520
 the super apostles for accepting it?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.880
 Many attempts to present a unified understanding of Paul's financial policy fail because

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.840
 they propose solutions that can only account for a few of these apparent discrepancies.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.880
 However, the Dorian Principle explains Paul's behavior in each instance.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.000
 Though I believe I have sufficiently established the truth that the Dorian Principle from other

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 texts, resolving these last two apparent discrepancies should afford us an extra level

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.840
 of confidence.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.360
 Paul's disposition toward other ministers.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.120
 If the Dorian Principle dictates Paul's behavior rather than pragmatic concerns, we should

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.040
 see the apostle require the same behavior from his associates.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.240
 Indeed, this is what we find.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.240
 In fact, when he describes this policy, he frequent employs the language of "we" referring

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.720
 to the others who traveled with him, 1 Corinthians 9/11-12.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.680
 For example, he explicitly names Barnabas as one who has performed manual labor to avoid

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.400
 taking money from the Corinthians.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.400
 1 Corinthians 9-6.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.920
 Further, Paul remarks that he has not even been a burden through those whom he has sent,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:37.320
 specifically mentioning Titus' 1 example, 2 Corinthians 12, 17-18.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.880
 And just as Paul willingly accepts Propipo's support, he commands that Titus receive it

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.400
 as well, 1 Corinthians 16-11.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.840
 However, Paul has no objection to the Jerusalem apostles receiving freely from the Corinthians.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.480
 Do we not have the right to eat and drink?

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.080
 Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife as do the other apostles and the brothers

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.520
 of the Lord and Seaphys, 1 Corinthians 9-4-5?

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.320
 Paul mentions Seaphys, another name for Peter, and the brothers of the Lord, likely including

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.280
 James, C.F. Galatians 119.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.920
 These apostles from Jerusalem have apparently visited Corinth and received support rather

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.760
 than engaging in secular labor to pay their own way.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.040
 Of course, Paul does not really suggest he has no right to eat or drink or have a wife

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.520
 instead, he refers to the expenses incurred by each of these things in the financial support

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.080
 required.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.400
 And all this, Paul implicitly condones the Jerusalem apostles' reception of Corinthian

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.880
 support.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.200
 However, when a different group of teachers accepts money from the Corinthians, Paul condemns

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.880
 them harshly, these are the super apostles, false apostles who compete with Paul for prominence

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.300
 in Corinth.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.920
 Toward the end of 2 Corinthians, he offers a full defense of his own rejection of funds,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:14.120
 implicitly comparing himself to his opponents who have received funds, C.F. 2 Corinthians

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.120
 11-7.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.760
 However, even at the beginning of the epistle, he criticizes the reception of Corinthian

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.400
 money.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.560
 For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God's word, but as men of sincerity as commissioned

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.480
 by God and the sight of God, we speak in Christ.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.720
 2 Corinthians 217.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.640
 Why does Paul respond so differently towards his opponents in Corinth?

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.720
 It might appear that he engages in partiality by labeling them peddlers, yet turning a blind

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.520
 eye to the Jerusalem apostles when they accept money from the Corinthians.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.120
 This accusation would stand if he condemns the super apostles' reception of funds simply

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.560
 because they propagate false doctrine.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:04.320
 However, the accusation of partiality falls apart if instead he has identified a fundamental

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.320
 error in their fundraising activities.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.400
 Paul's consistency toward the Jerusalem apostles.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.360
 After imposing a strict policy on himself and his companions, does Paul give a free pass

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.160
 to the apostles from Jerusalem?

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.760
 Once again, the Dorian principle resolves this matter neatly.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:32.520
 And Corinth, Paul's continued refusal of money revolves around the particular sum offered

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.160
 on his initial visit.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:43.680
 He regards this as payment for the gospel, CF First Corinthians 918, ministerial reciprocity.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.480
 The apostle never receives money from those he is converting.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:53.440
 However, as we have already noted, Paul willingly receives money from his churches when the

00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:00.880
 context does not indicate that they intend to repay him for his money or for their conversion.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.120
 The Jerusalem apostles arrived at an established church and would have not received the same

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.320
 offer that Paul received.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.720
 The finance is given to them must have been granted in another context.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.680
 Likely in the weekly contributions, a church collects in order to support the proclamation

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.680
 of the gospel.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.920
 In short, Paul condones other apostles accepting money from the Corinthians because this

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.640
 money would have been given as co-labor.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:34.040
 In contrast to the reciprocal offering of a grateful convert, these funds constitute the

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.960
 assistance of an established Christian.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:42.160
 The former implies a direct obligation to the minister who first shared the gospel, but

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:47.040
 the latter acknowledges an obligation mediated by God.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.800
 Paul's consistency toward the super apostles.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.400
 We see that Paul allows the Jerusalem apostles to receive money from the current, but condemns

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.680
 the super apostles when they do the same.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:05.280
 On one hand, it seems appealing to assume Paul grants privileges to true teachers that

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.640
 he does not grant to false teachers.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:14.340
 However, he calls their reception a material support burdensome, even an act of devouring,

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.400
 second current the ends of 1121.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:23.000
 Labeling their financial practices abusive, he leaves no room for a true apostle to engage

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.960
 in the same behavior.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:31.000
 Certainly, false apostles should not receive support due a true minister, but Paul objects

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.520
 to their financial practice in its own right.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:40.200
 In fact, Paul explicitly confirms that he holds them to the same financial standards he

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.440
 holds himself to.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.400
 And what I am doing, I will continue to do, in order to undermine the claim of those who

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:53.120
 would like to claim that in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.280
 Second Corinthians 1112.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:01.780
 That is, Paul maintains his policy of refusing payment to show that his opponents do not

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.860
 live up to the same code of conduct.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.460
 In order for Paul to act consistently in this matter, he must identify the current the

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:15.140
 and contributions to the super apostles as acts of ministerial reciprocity.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.580
 Indeed, he does.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:22.140
 When he responds to the objections of the super apostles, he compares their practice of

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:27.460
 charging for the gospel to his own practice of preaching freely.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:32.540
 Where did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted?

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.100
 Because I preached God's gospel to you free of charge?

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.540
 Second Corinthians 117.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:43.700
 And saying that he is not charged for his preaching, Paul implies that the super apostles

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.060
 have charge for their preaching.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:52.900
 Additionally, when he accuses them of peddling the gospel, second Corinthians 217, he condemns

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.460
 their activities as commercial transactions.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:03.020
 The super apostles have not aired and receiving money in general, but in receiving it in direct

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.540
 exchange for the gospel.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:10.300
 If they instead sought to collabor with the Corinthians, Paul would not raise the same

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.140
 objections.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:18.540
 The Dorian Principle sufficiently accounts for the disparity in the apostles' attitude toward

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:26.820
 the financial practices of his friends and toward those of his opponents.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.500
 A false claim on Corinth.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:36.420
 Examining the relationship between the super apostles in Corinth, we can see why the exchange

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.500
 between them constitutes payment.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:44.980
 The ministry of the super apostles more closely imitates the ministry of Paul than it does that

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.660
 of the Jerusalem apostles.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:54.300
 That is, the super apostles implicitly claim his spiritual fatherhood as their own, masquerading

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.140
 as church planters.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:03.220
 Paul demonstrates this pretense most directly in second Corinthians 10, arguing that the fruit

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:07.100
 of his labor serves as sufficient proof of status.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:12.500
 The apostle objects to his opponent's practice of self-commandation in verse 12 and verse

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.900
 18.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:20.500
 During these bookings, he offers a comparison to his own practices.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:25.940
 But we will not boast beyond limits, but will boast only with regard to the area of influence

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:29.900
 God assigned to us to reach even to you.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.660
 For we are not overextending ourselves as though we did not reach you.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:40.060
 For we were the first to come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:44.620
 We do not boast beyond limit in the labors of others, but our hope is that as your

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:50.980
 faith increases, our area of influence among you may be greatly enlarged so that we may

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:58.060
 preach the gospel in lands beyond you, without boasting of works already done in another area

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.220
 of influence.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:08.060
 Of the one who boasts, boasts in the Lord, second Corinthians 10, 13, through 17.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:13.740
 When Paul claims that he does not boast beyond limits, he implies that the super apostles

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.620
 do boast beyond limits.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:22.220
 Terms such as limits, area, overextending, reach, etc.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:27.060
 Indicates some geographic extent, especially given that Paul pairs them with the notion of

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:34.660
 the gospel expanding beyond Corinth and Echea, second Corinthians 10, 16, 11, 10.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:41.220
 In other words, the apostle considers the church in Corinth his divinely appointed domain,

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:45.540
 but his opponents consider it the fruit of their labors.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:50.780
 Paul expresses similar concerns elsewhere, declaring that as a church planter, he does

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:59.380
 not go where Christ has not been named, building on another's foundation, Romans 1520.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:04.180
 On the other hand, his opponents are eager to operate as pseudomissionaries who lay claim

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.940
 to another's work.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:12.060
 To be clear, Paul takes no issue with others building on his foundation, 1 Corinthians

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.180
 36, 12 through 13.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:20.620
 Rather, he objects to those who would wrongly assume the status of one who lays a foundation,

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.860
 hence his focus on boasting.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:29.020
 Perhaps it is too implausible to suggest that the apostles have explicitly labeled themselves

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:33.220
 the founders or spiritual fathers of the Corinthian church.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:40.140
 But by his comparisons, Paul at least charges them with having implicitly done so.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:46.020
 They overextend themselves, claiming dominion over a region they did not reach first,

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.260
 2 Corinthians 10-14.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:53.380
 They boast beyond limit in the labors of others, 2 Corinthians 10-15.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:59.020
 They take credit for work already done, 2 Corinthians 10-16.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.580
 What is that work other than the work of church planting?

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:08.100
 If nothing else, we may say Paul's opponents encroach on the achievements of his ministry,

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:13.500
 taking evangelical credit for the spiritual prosperity of Corinth.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:18.460
 Placing themselves in Paul's position, the super apostles eagerly run into the ethical

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.820
 transgression Paul avoided.

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.340
 They accept the payment from their supposed converts.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.740
 A false gospel.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.660
 This brings us to a final observation.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:35.300
 Paul never explicitly defines the false gospel of the super apostles.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:40.340
 He claims that his opponents come with another Jesus, a different spirit, and a different

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.340
 gospel.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:43.860
 2 Corinthians 11-4.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.780
 But never elaborates beyond this.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:51.540
 Perhaps Paul and the Corinthians share a mutual understanding of an unspoken issue, but

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:57.260
 the idea of leaving unaddressed some doctrinal error, spreading in Corinth, flies in the

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.100
 face of Paul's pattern in agenda.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:05.380
 But Paul's doctrine must be countered, and given his response to Galatia, a false gospel

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:11.340
 is so detrimental that it calls for the formal pronouncement of anathema.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.300
 Galatians 1-8-9.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:20.060
 It seems more likely that the super apostles represent a different Christ by falsely claiming

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.780
 they have been sent by Christ.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:28.580
 Likewise, their false spirit and false gospel may be the promotion of external appearances

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.940
 over inner truth.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:34.540
 Instead of exalting Christ, they exalt themselves.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.140
 In this case, Paul does address their false gospel.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.140
 Head on.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:45.780
 Rather than imagining some overt heresy that remains unspoken in the course of this epistle,

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:51.620
 we should recognize as primary those problems the apostle explicitly addresses.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:56.460
 The false gospel of Paul's opponents is no straightforward doctrinal error, but the

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:01.860
 very thing that concerns him throughout the epistle, a disposition that boasts in self

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.380
 instead of in the Lord.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:10.020
 This claim to the church in Corinth sets the capstone of the intruder's transgressions.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:14.580
 First, it is the greatest manifestation of their boasting.

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:20.460
 It does not merely misidentify external appearances as being worthy of honor.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:26.620
 What goes beyond even that which is true, as a puffed up peacock's feathers extend

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:33.260
 glamorously above its head, the super apostles' boasts reach far beyond limit.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:38.820
 Second, this is the greatest manifestation of their false apostleship.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:43.980
 They do not merely claim to have authority from Christ, but even claim to do the exact

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.180
 work Christ commissioned Paul to do.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.860
 Conclusion.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:55.100
 Paul condemns the super apostles' reception of support because they accepted as payment,

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:59.500
 setting themselves up as church planters owed by their converts.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:05.060
 Conversely, he condones the Jerusalem apostles' reception of support because they accepted

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.540
 as co-labor.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:13.340
 At this point, the Dorian principle has resolved for apparent discrepancies in Paul's disposition

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.380
 toward financial support.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:22.940
 In the next chapter, we will broaden our exploration to see that this fundraising ethic is not merely

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:29.260
 showcased in a few edge cases of apostolic ministry, but pervades the whole of the New Testament

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.860
 and even appears in the Old Testament.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:33.700
 End of chapter 8
