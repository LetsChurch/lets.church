## Roadmap (The Future of Let's Church)

We have many new technology upgrades and features in the works for Let's Church.
Technology

- Additional servers for creating transcriptions and transcoding videos to speed up processing and onboarding. What currently takes several days will soon take minutes to hours.
- Additional transcript data to enable new features, including word-level timestamps (each word will have its own timestamp) for better segmentation and better search results.
- Live streaming capabilities (this will require additional specialized hardware and has its own challenges compared to standard video streaming).
- A mobile app.

## Features and User Experience

- Improved search and organization. Media will have tags so you can more easily differentiate between, e.g., sermons and podcasts. We will also implement channel search so you can more easily find who is on the platform.
- We will implement the ability to search your watch history.
- Church search. We are working on building out a map-enabled church search feature which will enable you to find and connect with local churches all around the country and, Lord willing, around the world. Creating podcasts for listing in podcast apps directly from media uploaded to Let's Church. Church website builder. We want to provide churches an easy way to create their own websites and easily embed the content they've already uploaded to Let's Church.
- Blogging and community features.
- Bookmarks and notes.
- Sermon notes.
- More sections, e.g., most-watched videos, most-liked videos, and trending topics.
