## The Apostles' Creed {#apostles-creed}

I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth. And in Jesus
Christ, His only Son, our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of
the Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and
buried; He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead; He
ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty;
from thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the
Holy Ghost; the holy catholic[\*](#apostles-creed-catholic) Church, the communion of
saints; the forgiveness of sins; the resurrection of the body; and the life
everlasting. Amen.

## The Nicene Creed {#nicene-creed}

I believe in one God the Father Almighty; Maker of heaven and earth, and of all
things visible and invisible.

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the
Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God,
begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father; by whom all things
were made; who, for us men and for our salvation, came down from heaven, and
was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary, and was made man; and was
crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was buried; and the
third day he rose again, according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven,
and sitteth on the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again, with
glory, to judge both the quick and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end.

And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life; who proceedeth from the
Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and
glorified; who spake by the Prophets. And one holy
catholic[\*](#nicene-creed-catholic) and apostolic church. I acknowledge one baptism
for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the
life of the world to come. Amen.

<small id="nicene-creed-catholic">\* catholic means "universal" and is not a reference to the Roman Catholic Church.</small>

## The Chalcedonian Creed {#chalcedonian-creed}

We then, following the holy Fathers, all with one consent, teach men to confess
one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, the same perfect in Godhead and
also perfect in manhood; truly God and truly man, of a reasonable soul and
body; consubstantial with the Father according to the Godhead, and
consubstantial with us according to the Manhood; in all things like unto us,
without sin; begotten before all ages of the Father according to the Godhead,
and in these latter days, for us and for our salvation, born of the Virgin
Mary, the Mother of God, according to the Manhood; one and the same Christ,
Son, Lord, Only-begotten, to be acknowledged in two natures, inconfusedly,
unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably; the distinction of natures being by no
means taken away by the union, but rather the property of each nature being
preserved, and concurring in one Person and one Subsistence, not parted or
divided into two persons, but one and the same Son, and only begotten, God the
Word, the Lord Jesus Christ, as the prophets from the beginning have declared
concerning him, and the Lord Jesus Christ himself has taught us, and the Creed
of the holy Fathers handed down to us.

## The Athanasian Creed {#athanasian-creed}

1. Whosoever will be saved: before all things it is necessary that he hold the
   catholic[\*](#athanasian-creed-catholic) Faith:
2. Which Faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled: without doubt he
   shall perish everlastingly.
3. And the catholic[\*](#athanasian-creed-catholic) Faith is this: That we
   worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity;
4. Neither confounding the Persons: nor dividing the Substance.
5. For there is one Person of the Father: another of the Son: and another of
   the Holy Spirit.
6. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, is all
   one: the Glory equal, the Majesty coeternal.
7. Such as the Father is: such is the Son: and such is the Holy Spirit.
8. The Father uncreated: the Son uncreated: and the Holy Spirit uncreated.
9. The Father incomprehensible: the Son incomprehensible: and the Holy Spirit
   incomprehensible.
10. The Father eternal: the Son eternal: and the Holy Spirit eternal.
11. And yet they are not three eternals: but one eternal.
12. And also there are not three uncreated: nor three incomprehensibles, but
    one uncreated: and one incomprehensible.
13. So likewise the Father is Almighty: the Son Almighty: and the Holy Spirit
    Almighty.
14. And yet they are not three Almighties: but one Almighty.
15. So the Father is God: the Son is God: and the Holy Spirit is God.
16. And yet they are not three Gods: but one God.
17. So likewise the Father is Lord: the Son Lord: and the Holy Spirit Lord.
18. And yet not three Lords: but one Lord:
19. For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity: to acknowledge every
    Person by himself to be God and Lord:
20. So are we forbidden by the catholic[\*](#athanasian-creed-catholic) Religion: to
    say, There be three Gods, or three Lords.
21. The Father is made of none: neither created, nor begotten.
22. The Son is of the Father alone: not made, nor created: but begotten.
23. The Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son: neither made, nor created,
    nor begotten: but proceeding.
24. So there is one Father, not three Fathers: one Son, not three Sons: one
    Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits.
25. And in this Trinity none is afore, or after another: none is greater, or
    less than another.
26. But the whole three Persons are coeternal, and coequal.
27. So that in all things, as aforesaid: the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity
    in Unity, is to be worshipped.
28. He therefore that will be saved, must thus think of the Trinity.
29. Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation: that he also believe
    rightly the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
30. For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess: that our Lord Jesus
    Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man.
31. God, of the Substance of the Father; begotten before the worlds: and Man,
    of the Substance of His Mother, born into the world.
32. Perfect God: and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh
    subsisting.
33. Equal to the Father, as touching His Godhead: and inferior to the Father as
    touching His Manhood.
34. Who although He be God and Man; yet He is not two, but one Christ.
35. One; not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh: but by taking of the
    Manhood into God.
36. One altogether; not by confusion of Substance: but by unity of Person.
37. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man; so God and Man is one
    Christ;
38. Who suffered for our salvation: descended into hell: rose again the third
    day from the dead.
39. He ascended into heaven, He sitteth on the right hand of the Father God
    Almighty.
40. From whence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.
41. At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies;
42. And shall give account for their own works.
43. And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting: and they that
    have done evil, into everlasting fire.
44. This is the catholic[\*](#athanasian-creed-catholic) Faith: which except a man
    believe faithfully, he can not be saved.

<small id="athanasian-creed-catholic">\* catholic means "universal" and is not a reference to the Roman Catholic Church.</small>

## The Five Solas of the Protestant Reformation {#five-solas}

1. **Sola Scriptura** - Scripture alone is the ultimate authority for Christian
   faith and practice, not tradition or the teachings of the church.
2. **Sola Fide** - Justification is by faith alone, and not by good works or
   any merit of our own.
3. **Sola Gratia** - Salvation is by grace alone, and not by any merit or
   worthiness on our part.
4. **Solus Christus** - Salvation is found in Christ alone, and not in any
   other person or religious system.
5. **Soli Deo Gloria** - All glory and honor belongs to God alone, and not to
   any human or created thing.

## The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy {#chicago-statement}

### Preface

The authority of Scripture is a key issue for the Christian Church in this and
every age. Those who profess faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior are
called to show the reality of their discipleship by humbly and faithfully
obeying God’s written Word. To stray from Scripture in faith or conduct is
disloyalty to our Master. Recognition of the total truth and trustworthiness of
Holy Scripture is essential to a full grasp and adequate confession of its
authority.

The following Statement affirms this inerrancy of Scripture afresh, making
clear our understanding of it and warning against its denial. We are persuaded
that to deny it is to set aside the witness of Jesus Christ and of the Holy
Spirit and to refuse that submission to the claims of God’s own Word which
marks true Christian faith. We see it as our timely duty to make this
affirmation in the face of current lapses from the truth of inerrancy among our
fellow Christians and misunderstanding of this doctrine in the world at large.

This Statement consists of three parts: a Summary Statement, Articles of
Affirmation and Denial, and an accompanying Exposition. It has been prepared in
the course of a three-day consultation in Chicago. Those who have signed the
Summary Statement and the Articles wish to affirm their own conviction as to
the inerrancy of Scripture and to encourage and challenge one another and all
Christians to growing appreciation and understanding of this doctrine. We
acknowledge the limitations of a document prepared in a brief, intensive
conference and do not propose that Statement be given credal weight. Yet we
rejoice in the deepening of our own convictions through our discussions
together, and we pray that the Statement we have signed may be used to the
glory of our God toward a new reformation of the Church in its faith, life and
mission.

We offer this Statement in a spirit, not of contention, but of humility and
love, which we by God’s grace to maintain in any future dialoge arising out of
what we have said. We gladly acknowledge that many who deny the inerrancy of
Scripture do not display the consequences of this denial in the rest of their
belief and behaviour, and we are conscious that we who confess this doctrine
often deny it in life by failing to bring our thoughts and deeds, our
traditions and habits, into true subjection to the divine Word.

We invite response to this statement from who see reason to amend its
affirmations about Scripture by the light of Scripture itself, under whose
infallible authority we stand as we speak. We claim no personal infallibility
for the witness we bear, and for any help which enables us to strengthen this
testimony to God’s Word we shall be grateful.

### A Short Statement

1. God, who is Himself Truth and speaks truth only, has inspired Holy Scripture
   in order thereby to reveal Himself to lost mankind through Jesus Christ as
   Creator and Lord, Redeemer and Judge. Holy Scripture is God’s witness to
   Himself.
2. Holy Scripture, being God’s own Word, written by men prepared and
   superintended by His Spirit, is of infallible divine authority in all
   matters upon which it touches: it is to be believed, as God’s instruction,
   in all that it affirms; obeyed, as God’s command, in all that it requires;
   embraced, as God’s pledge, in all that it promises.
3. The Holy Spirit, Scripture’s divine Author, both authenticates it to us by
   His inward witness and opens our minds to understand its meaning.
4. Being wholly and verbally God-given, Scripture is without error or fault in
   all its teaching, no less in what it states about God’s acts in creation,
   about the events of world history, and about its own literary origins under
   God, than in its witness to God’s saving grace in individual lives.
5. The authority of Scripture is inescapably impaired if this total divine
   inerrancy is in any way limited or disregarded, or made relative to a view
   of truth contrary to the Bible’s own; and such lapses bring serious loss to
   both the individual and the Church.

### Articles of Affirmation and Denial

#### Article I

We affirm that the Holy Scriptures are to be received as the authoritative Word
of God. We deny that the Scriptures receive their authority from the Church,
tradition, or any other human service.

#### Article II

We affirm that the Scriptures are the supreme written norm by which God binds
the conscience, and that the authority of the Church is subordinate to that of
Scripture.

We deny that Church creeds, councils, or declarations have authority greater
than or equal to the authority of the Bible.

#### Article III

We affirm that the written Word in its entirety is revelation given by God.

We deny that the Bible is merely a witness to revelation, or only becomes
revelation in encounter, or depends on the responses of men for its validity.

#### Article IV

We affirm that God who made mankind in His image has used language as a means
of revelation. We deny that human language is so limited by our creatureliness
that it is rendered inadequate as a vehicle for divine revelation. We further
deny that the corruption of human culture and language through sin has thwarted
God’s work of inspiration.

#### Article V

We affirm that God’s revelation within the Holy Scriptures was progressive.

We deny that later revelation, which may fulfill earlier revelation, ever
corrects or contradicts it. We further deny that any normative revelation has
been given since the completion of the New Testament writings.

#### Article VI

We affirm that the whole of Scripture and all its parts, down to the very words
of the original, were given by divine inspiration. We deny that the inspiration
of Scripture can rightly be affirmed of the whole without the parts, or of some
parts but not the whole.

#### Article VII

We affirm that inspiration was the work in which God by His Spirit, through
human writers, gave us His Word. The origin of Scripture is divine. The mode of
divine inspiration remains largely a mystery to us.

We deny that inspiration can be reduced to human insight, or to heightened
states of consciousness of any kind.

#### Article VIII

We affirm that God in His work of inspiration utilized the distinctive
personalities and literary styles of the writers whom He had chosen and
prepared.

We deny that God, in causing these writers to use the very words that He chose,
overrode their personalities.

#### Article IX

We affirm that inspiration, though not conferring omniscience, guaranteed true
and trustworthy utterance on all matters of which the Biblical authors were
moved to speak and write.

We deny that the finitude of fallenness of these writers, by necessity or
otherwise, introduced distortion or falsehood into God’s Word.

#### Article X

We affirm that inspiration, strictly speaking, applies only to the autographic
text of Scripture, which in the providence of God can be ascertained from
available manuscripts with great accuracy. We further affirm that copies and
translations of Scripture are the Word of God to the extent that they
faithfully represent the original.

We deny that any essential element of the Christian faith is affected by the
absence of the autographs. We further deny that this absence renders the
assertion of Biblical inerrancy invalid or irrelevant.

#### Article XI

We affirm that Scripture, having been given by divine inspiration, is
infallible, so that, far from misleading us, it is true and reliable in all the
matters it addresses.

We deny that it is possible for the Bible to be at the same time infallible and
errant in its assertions. Infallibility and inerrancy may be distinguished, but
not separated.

#### Article XII

We affirm that Scripture in its entirety is inerrant, being free from all
falsehood, fraud, or deceit.

We deny that Biblical infallibility and inerrancy are limited to spiritual,
religious, or redemptive themes, exclusive of assertions in the fields of
history and science. We further deny that scientific hypotheses about earth
history may properly be used to overturn the teaching of Scripture on creation
and the flood.

#### Article XIII

We affirm the propriety of using inerrancy as a theological term with reference
to the complete truthfulness of Scripture.

We deny that it is proper to evaluate Scripture according to standards of truth
and error that are alien to its usage or purpose. We further deny that
inerrancy is negated by Biblical phenomena such as a lack of modern technical
precision, irregularities of grammar or spelling, observational descriptions of
nature, the reporting of falsehoods, the use of hyperbole and round numbers,
the topical arrangement of material, variant selections of material in parallel
accounts, or the use of free citations.

#### Article XIV

We affirm the unity and internal consistency of Scripture.

We deny that alleged errors and discrepancies that have not yet been resolved
vitiate the truth claims of the Bible.

#### Article XV

We affirm that the doctrine of inerrancy is ground in the teaching of the Bible
about inspiration.

We deny that Jesus’ teaching about Scripture may be dismissed by appeals to
accommodation or to any natural limitation of His humanity.

#### Article XVI

We affirm that the doctrine of inerrancy has been integral to the Church’s
faith throughout its history.

We deny that inerrancy is a doctrine invented by scholastic Protestantism, or
is a reactionary position postulated in response to negative higher criticism.

#### Article XVII

We affirm that the Holy Spirit bears witness to the Scriptures, assuring
believers of the truthfulness of God’s written Word.

We deny that this witness of the Holy Spirit operates in isolation from or
against Scripture.

#### Article XVIII

We affirm that the text of Scripture is to be interpreted by
grammatico-historical exegesis, taking account of its literary forms and
devices, and that Scripture is to interpret Scripture.

We deny the legitimacy of any treatment of the text or quest for sources lying
behind it that leads to relativizing, dehistoricizing, or discounting its
teaching, or rejecting its claims to authorship.

#### Article XIX

We affirm that a confession of the full authority, infallibility, and inerrancy
of Scripture is vital to a sound understanding of the whole of the Christian
faith. We further affirm that such confession should lead to increasing
conformity to the image of Christ.

We deny that such confession is necessary for salvation. However, we further
deny that inerrancy can be rejected without grave consequences, both to the
individual and to the Church.

## The Statement on Social Justice & the Gospel {#social-justice-statement}

### I. Scripture

**WE AFFIRM** that the Bible is God’s Word, breathed out by him. It is
inerrant, infallible, and the final authority for determining what is true
(what we must believe) and what is right (how we must live). All truth claims
and ethical standards must be tested by God’s final Word, which is Scripture
alone.

**WE DENY** that Christian belief, character, or conduct can be dictated by any
other authority, and we deny that the postmodern ideologies derived from
intersectionality, radical feminism, and critical race theo- ry are consistent
with biblical teaching. We further deny that competency to teach on any
biblical issue comes from any qualification for spiritual people other than
clear understanding and simple communica- tion of what is revealed in
Scripture.

**SCRIPTURE:** GENESIS 2:18-25; PSALM 19:7-10; 1 CORINTHIANS 2:14-15; EPHESIANS
5:22-33; 2 TIMO- THY 3:16-4:5; HEBREWS 4:12; 13:4; 1 PETER 1:25; 2 PETER
1:19-21

### II. Imago Dei

**WE AFFIRM** that God created every person equally in his own image. As divine
image-bearers, all people have inestimable value and dignity before God and
deserve honor, respect and protection. Everyone has been created by God and for
God.

**WE DENY** that God-given roles, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, religion,
sex or physical condition or any other property of a person either negates or
contributes to that individual’s worth as an image-bearer of God.

**SCRIPTURE:** GENESIS 1:26-30; 2:18-22; 9:6; 2 CORINTHIANS 5:17; COLOSSIANS
1:21-22

### III. Justice

**WE AFFIRM** that since he is holy, righteous, and just, God requires those
who bear his image to live justly in the world. This includes showing
appropriate respect to every person and giving to each one what he or she is
due. We affirm that societies must establish laws to correct injustices that
have been imposed through cultural prejudice.

**WE DENY** that true justice can be culturally defined or that standards of
justice that are merely socially constructed can be imposed with the same
authority as those that are derived from Scripture. We further deny that
Christians can live justly in the world under any principles other than the
biblical standard of righteousness. Relativism, socially-constructed standards
of truth or morality, and notions of virtue and vice that are constantly in
flux cannot result in authentic justice.

**SCRIPTURE:** GENESIS 18:19; ISAIAH 61:8; MICAH 6:8; MATTHEW 5:17-19; ROMANS
3:31

### IV. God’s Law

**WE AFFIRM** that God’s law, as summarized in the ten commandments, more
succinctly summarized in the two great commandments, and manifested in Jesus
Christ, is the only standard of unchanging righ- teousness. Violation of that
law is what constitutes sin.

**WE DENY** that any obligation that does not arise from God’s commandments can
be legitimately imposed on Christians as a prescription for righteous living.
We further deny the legitimacy of any charge of sin or call to repentance that
does not arise from a violation of God’s commandments.

**SCRIPTURE:** DEUTERONOMY 10:4; ROMANS 6:14, 10:5; GALATIANS 2:16, 3:10, 12;
COLOSSIANS 2:14- 17; HEBREWS 10:1

### V. Sin

**WE AFFIRM** that all people are connected to Adam both naturally and
federally. Therefore, because of original sin everyone is born under the curse
of God’s law and all break his commandments through sin. There is no difference
in the condition of sinners due to age, ethnicity, or sex. All are depraved in
all their faculties and all stand condemned before God’s law. All human
relationships, systems, and institutions have been affected by sin.

**WE DENY** that, other than the previously stated connection to Adam, any person
is morally culpable for another person’s sin. Although families, groups, and
nations can sin collectively, and cultures can be predisposed to particular
sins, subsequent generations share the collective guilt of their ancestors only
if they approve and embrace (or attempt to justify) those sins. Before God each
person must repent and confess his or her own sins in order to receive
forgiveness. We further deny that one’s ethnicity establish- es any
necessary connection to any particular sin.

**SCRIPTURE:** GENESIS 2:16, 17, 3:12,13-15; PROVERBS 29:18; ISAIAH 25:7, 60:2-3;
JEREMIAH 31:27-34; EZEKIEL 18:1-9, 14-18; MATTHEW 23:29-36; ROMANS 1:16-17,
3:23, 5:12, 10:14-17; 1 CORINTHIANS
15:3-11; 2 CORINTHIANS 11:3; GALATIANS 1:6-9; TITUS 1:12, 13; REVELATION 13:8

### VI. Gospel

**WE AFFIRM** that the gospel is the divinely-revealed message concerning the
person and work of Jesus Christ—especially his virgin birth, righteous life,
substitutionary sacrifice, atoning death, and bodily resurrection—revealing who
he is and what he has done with the promise that he will save anyone and
everyone who turns from sin by trusting him as Lord.

**WE DENY** that anything else, whether works to be performed or opinions to be
held, can be added to the gospel without perverting it into another gospel.
This also means that implications and applications of the gospel, such as the
obligation to live justly in the world, though legitimate and important in
their own right, are not definitional components of the gospel.

**SCRIPTURE:** GENESIS 3:15; PROVERBS 29:18; ISAIAH 25:7, 60:2, 3; ROMANS 1:16-17,
10:14,15,17; 1 CORINTHIANS 15:1-11; GALATIANS 1:6-9; REVELATION 13:8

### VII. Salvation

**WE AFFIRM** that salvation is granted by God’s grace alone received through
faith alone in Jesus Christ alone. Every believer is united to Christ,
justified before God, and adopted into his family. Thus, in God’s eyes there is
no difference in spiritual value or worth among those who are in Christ.
Further, all who are united to Christ are also united to one another regardless
of age, ethnicity, or sex. All believers are being conformed to the image of
Christ. By God’s regenerating and sanctifying grace all believers will be
brought to a final glorified, sinless state of perfection in the day of Jesus
Christ.

**WE DENY** that salvation can be received in any other way. We also deny that
salvation renders any Chris- tian free from all remaining sin or immune from
even grievous sin in this life. We further deny that ethnic- ity excludes
anyone from understanding the gospel, nor does anyone’s ethnic or cultural
heritage mitigate or remove the duty to repent and believe.

**SCRIPTURE:** GENESIS 3:15; ACTS 20:32; ROMANS 3-4; EPHESIANS 2:8-9; GALATIANS
3:28-29; 1 JOHN 2:1-2

### VIII. The Church

**WE AFFIRM** that the primary role of the church is to worship God through the
preaching of his word, teaching sound doctrine, observing baptism and the
Lord’s Supper, refuting those who contradict, equip- ping the saints, and
evangelizing the lost. We affirm that when the primacy of the gospel is
maintained that this often has a positive effect on the culture in which
various societal ills are mollified. We affirm that, under the lordship of
Christ, we are to obey the governing authorities established by God and pray
for civil leaders.

**WE DENY** that political or social activism should be viewed as integral
components of the gospel or pri- mary to the mission of the church. Though
believers can and should utilize all lawful means that God has providentially
established to have some effect on the laws of a society, we deny that these
activities are either evidence of saving faith or constitute a central part of
the church’s mission given to her by Jesus Christ, her head. We deny that laws
or regulations possess any inherent power to change sinful hearts.

**SCRIPTURE:** MATTHEW 28:16-20; ROMANS 13:1-7; 1 TIMOTHY 2:1-3; 2 TIMOTHY 4:2;
TITUS 1:9; 1 PETER 2:13-17

### IX. Heresy

**WE AFFIRM** that heresy is a denial of or departure from a doctrine that is
essential to the Christian faith. We further affirm that heresy often involves
the replacement of key, essential truths with variant con- cepts, or the
elevation of non-essentials to the status of essentials. To embrace heresy is
to depart from the faith once delivered to the saints and thus to be on a path
toward spiritual destruction. We affirm that the accusation of heresy should be
reserved for those departures from Christian truth that destroy the
weight-bearing doctrines of the redemptive core of Scripture. We affirm that
accusations of heresy should be accompanied with clear evidence of such
destructive beliefs.

**WE DENY** that the charge of heresy can be legitimately brought against every
failure to achieve perfect conformity to all that is implied in sincere faith
in the gospel.

**SCRIPTURE:** JOHN 14:6; ACTS 4:12; GALATIANS 1:6-9; 1 JOHN 4:1-3, 10, 14, 15;
5:1, 6-12

### X. Sexuality and Marriage

**WE AFFIRM** that God created mankind male and female and that this divinely
determined distinction is good, proper, and to be celebrated. Maleness and
femaleness are biologically determined at conception and are not subject to
change. The curse of sin results in sinful, disordered affections that manifest
in some people as same-sex attraction. Salvation grants sanctifying power to
renounce such dishonorable affections as sinful and to mortify them by the
Spirit. We further affirm that God’s design for marriage is that one woman and
one man live in a one-flesh, covenantal, sexual relationship until separated by
death. Those who lack the desire or opportunity for marriage are called to
serve God in singleness and chastity. This is as noble a calling as marriage.

**WE DENY** that human sexuality is a socially constructed concept. We also
deny that one’s sex can be fluid. We reject “gay Christian” as a legitimate
biblical category. We further deny that any kind of partnership or union can
properly be called marriage other than one man and one woman in lifelong
covenant together. We further deny that people should be identified as “sexual
minorities”—which serves as a cultural classi- fication rather than one that
honors the image-bearing character of human sexuality as created by God.

**SCRIPTURE:** GENESIS 1:26-27, 2:24, 4:1, 19:24-28; MATTHEW 19:3-6; ROMANS
8:13; 1 CORINTHIANS 6:9-11; 1 TIMOTHY 1:10; JUDE 7

### XI. Complementarianism

**WE AFFIRM** that God created mankind both male and female with inherent
biological and personal dis- tinctions between them and that these created
differences are good, proper, and beautiful. Though there is no difference
between men and women before God’s law or as recipients of his saving grace, we
affirm that God has designed men and women with distinct traits and to fulfill
distinct roles. These differenc- es are most clearly defined in marriage and
the church, but are not irrelevant in other spheres of life. In marriage the
husband is to lead, love, and safeguard his wife and the wife is to respect and
be submissive to her husband in all things lawful. In the church, qualified men
alone are to lead as pastors/elders/bish- ops and preach to and teach the whole
congregation. We further affirm that the image of God is expressed most fully
and beautifully in human society when men and women walk in obedience to their
God-or- dained roles and serve according to their God-given gifts.

**WE DENY** that the God-ordained differences in men’s and women’s roles
disparage the inherent spiritual worth or value of one over the other, nor do
those differences in any way inhibit either men or women from flourishing for
the glory of God.

**SCRIPTURE:** GENESIS 1:26–28, 2:15-25, 3:1-24; EPHESIANS 5:22-33; 1
CORINTHIANS 11:7-9; 1 TIMO- THY 2:12-14; TITUS 2

### XII. Race / Ethnicity

**WE AFFIRM** God made all people from one man. Though people often can be
distinguished by different ethnicities and nationalities, they are ontological
equals before God in both creation and redemption. “Race” is not a biblical
category, but rather a social construct that often has been used to classify
groups of people in terms of inferiority and superiority. All that is good,
honest, just, and beautiful in various eth- nic backgrounds and experiences can
be celebrated as the fruit of God’s grace. All sinful actions and their results
(including evils perpetrated between and upon ethnic groups by others) are to
be confessed as sinful, repented of, and repudiated.

**WE DENY** that Christians should segregate themselves into racial groups or
regard racial identity above, or even equal to, their identity in Christ. We
deny that any divisions between people groups (from an un- stated attitude of
superiority to an overt spirit of resentment) have any legitimate place in the
fellowship of the redeemed. We reject any teaching that encourages racial
groups to view themselves as privileged oppressors or entitled victims of
oppression. While we are to weep with those who weep, we deny that a person’s
feelings of offense or oppression necessarily prove that someone else is guilty
of sinful behav- iors, oppression, or prejudice.

**SCRIPTURE:** GENESIS 1:26–28; ACTS 17:24-26; 1 CORINTHIANS 13:4-7; 2
CORINTHIANS 12:16-18

### XIII. Culture

**WE AFFIRM** that some cultures operate on assumptions that are inherently
better than those of other cultures because of the biblical truths that inform
those worldviews that have produced these distinct assumptions. Those elements
of a given culture that reflect divine revelation should be celebrated and
promoted. But the various cultures out of which we have been called all have
features that are worldly and sinful—and therefore those sinful features should
be repudiated for the honor of Christ. We affirm that whatever evil influences
to which we have been subjected via our culture can be—and must be— overcome
through conversion and the training of both mind and heart through biblical
truth.

**WE DENY** that individuals and sub-groups in any culture are unable, by God’s
grace, to rise above whatev- er moral defects or spiritual deficiencies have
been engendered or encouraged by their respective cul- tures.

**SCRIPTURE:** ROMANS 1:18-32; EPHESIANS 4:17-24; COLOSSIANS 3:5-11

### XIV. Racism

**WE AFFIRM** that racism is a sin rooted in pride and malice which must be
condemned and renounced by all who would honor the image of God in all people.
Such racial sin can subtly or overtly manifest itself as racial animosity or
racial vainglory. Such sinful prejudice or partiality falls short of God’s
revealed will and violates the royal law of love. We affirm that virtually all
cultures, including our own, at times contain laws and systems that foster
racist attitudes and policies.

**WE DENY** that treating people with sinful partiality or prejudice is
consistent with biblical Christianity. We deny that only those in positions of
power are capable of racism, or that individuals of any particular ethnic
groups are incapable of racism. We deny that systemic racism is in any way
compatible with the core principles of historic evangelical convictions. We
deny that the Bible can be legitimately used to fos- ter or justify partiality,
prejudice, or contempt toward other ethnicities. We deny that the contemporary
evangelical movement has any deliberate agenda to elevate one ethnic group and
subjugate another. And we emphatically deny that lectures on social issues (or
activism aimed at reshaping the wider culture) are as vital to the life and
health of the church as the preaching of the gospel and the exposition of
Scripture. Historically, such things tend to become distractions that
inevitably lead to departures from the gospel.

**SCRIPTURE:** GENESIS 1:26-27; DEUTERONOMY 10:17; ACTS 10:34; ROMANS 2:11;
EPHESIANS 6:9; GALATIANS 3:28; JAMES 2:4
